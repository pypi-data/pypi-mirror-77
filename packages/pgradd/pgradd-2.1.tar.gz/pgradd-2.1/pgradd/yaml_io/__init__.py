"""
=======================
YAML-formatted data I/O
=======================

This module handles input from YAML formatted data.  Because this code is in
bad need of cleanup and because in the long run, I (Stephen Edie) hope to
replace the input mechanism with something cleaner and faster (not involving
YAML), the documentation for this module is limited at this time.
