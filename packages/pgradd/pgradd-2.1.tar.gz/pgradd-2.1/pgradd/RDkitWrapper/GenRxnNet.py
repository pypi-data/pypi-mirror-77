    """
    Generates reaction network following the algorithm from
    (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2010, 49 (21), 10459-10470)

    Arguments:
    - initial_reactant:     can be smiles or mol
    - reaction_rules:       can be smarts string or rdkit.Chem.rdChemReactions.
                            ChemicalReaction object

    Return:
    - list of reaction intermediates

    Example:
    Ethane C-H scission and C-C scission
    A = generate_rxn_net('CC',['[C:1][H:2]>>[C:1].[H:2]',
                         '[C:1][C:2]>>[C:1].[C:2]'])
    for product in A:
        print(Chem.MolToSmiles(product))

    Tip:
    For dehydrogenation, you must number carbon and hydrogen i.e.
    [C][H]>>[C].[H]             (x)
    [C:1][H:1]>>[C:1].[H:2]     (o)
    Same goes for changing bond order
    [C][C]>>[C]=[C]             (x)
    [C:1][C:2]>>[C:1]=[C:2]     (o)
    Aromatization and Kekulize has some problem with several species. So, we
    don't set aromatization for sanitize, and try kekulize.

    TODO:
    - record reactions as well (make it an option as it's expensive)
