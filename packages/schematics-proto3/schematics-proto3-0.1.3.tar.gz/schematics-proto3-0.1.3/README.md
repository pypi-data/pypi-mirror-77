# schematics-proto3
Built upon [Schematics](https://schematics.readthedocs.io) - *Python Data
Structures for Humansâ„¢*, ``schematics-proto3`` brings the awesome features
of [Schematics](https://schematics.readthedocs.io>) to Protobuf 3 world.

## Caution
Library is currently in **WORK IN PROGRESS** state.

What is implemented and tested:

1. Loading Protobuf 3 messages to Model instances.
   * for most of the Protobuf 3 types, including
    [wrappers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto), ``repeated`` ``oneof`` fields
   * Enum type
1. Validation and structured error messages.

To be done:
1. Serializing Model instances to Protobuf 3 messages.
1. Make the library more user-friendly.
1. Schematics "roles".

## Installation
```
pip install schematics-proto3
```

## Motivation
As good and widely supported as it is, Protobuf 3 still has some quirks
which can make working with it painful and repetitive. Especially, building
complex gRPC services might reveal a number of deficiencies in available tooling.

``schematics-proto3`` aims to address this problem, in particular:

* [[#359](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/359>)]
  default values and testing if a field is set in v3

  [There is a workaround for this](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto>),
  ``schematics-proto3`` incorporates wrapper types to hide nested messages underneath.

* no proper data handling library

  Comparing to Serializers in Django Rest Framework or Marshmallow, there seems to be no full
  fledged serialization / validation / deserialization library for Protobuf 3.
  Thanks to [Schematics](https://schematics.readthedocs.io>), ``schematics-proto3``
  is able to provide:

  * declarative models
  * custom validation functions
  * structured error messages (currently only as Python dict)

Example
=======
Let's take [Schematics example](https://schematics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#example) and modify it to work with Protobuf.

We have a following Protobuf message (and ``person_pb2`` Python module).

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/protobuf/wrappers.proto";

package example;

message Person {
  google.protobuf.StringValue name = 1;
  google.protobuf.StringValue website = 2;
}
```

And reflect above message in ``Model`` class.

```python
from schematics_proto3 import Model
from schematics_proto3 import types as pbtypes

import person_pb2 as pb2


class PersonModel(Model, protobuf_message=pb2.Person):
    name = pbtypes.StringWrapperType()
    website = pbtypes.StringWrapperType()
```

Let's load some data.

```python
msg = pb2.Person()
msg.name.value = 'Jon Doe'
msg.website.value = 'https://example.com'

model = PersonModel.load_protobuf(msg)
model.validate()

assert model.name == 'Jon Doe'
assert model.website == 'https://example.com'

assert model.to_native() == {'name': 'Jon Doe', 'website': 'https://example.com'}
```

Not setting a field will give you an ``Unset``.

```python
from schematics_proto3.unset import Unset

msg = pb2.Person()
msg.name.value = 'Jon Doe'

model = PersonModel.load_protobuf(msg)
model.validate()

assert model.name == 'Jon Doe'
assert model.website is Unset
```
