named threading locks
=====================

Named locks are used in multi-threaded applications and based on the python threading lock classes
:class:`threading.Lock` and :class:`threading.RLock`. The advantage of the named locks in contrary
to python threading locks is that a lock don't need to create and store a reference of a python
threading lock object - the :class:`NamedLocks` does this automatically for your application and
does keep track of all the named locks of your application in its class variables.

So a named lock get exclusively identified only by an unique string. And for to create other
blocking locks you only need a reference to the :class:`NamedLocks` class.

Named locks are very useful e.g. if you want to lock a certain record of database table. For this
you simply create a new instance of the :class:`NamedLocks` class and as unique string you can use
the table name followed by the primary key of the record to lock::

    named_lock = NamedLocks()
    if named_lock.acquire(table_name + primary_key)

        ...     # locked database transaction code goes here

        named_lock.release(table_name + primary_key)

If now any other process of your application want to lock the same record (same table name and primary
key) then it will be blocked until the process that acquired this named lock first is releasing the
table record lock.

Alternatively and especially if your application want to create multiple named locks you can use the
class :class:`NamedLocks` as a context manager, passing all the named lock strings to the constructor::

    with NamedLocks(table_name1 + primary_key1, table_name2 + primary_key2, ...):
        ...     # locked database transaction
