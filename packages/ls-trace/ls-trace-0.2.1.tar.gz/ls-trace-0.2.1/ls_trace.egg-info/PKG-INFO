        # ls-trace-py
        
        Datadog has generously announced the [donation][donation post] of their tracer libraries
        to the [OpenTelemety][opentelemetry docs] project. Auto-instrumentation
        is a core feature of these libraries, making it possible to create and
        collect telemetry data without needing to change your code. LightStep
        wants you to be able to use these libraries now! We've forked the Datadog
        libraries into the LightStep repo as agents. You can install and use these agents to take advantage of
        auto-instrumentation without waiting for OpenTelemetry. Each LightStep agent
        is "pinned" to a Datadog release and is fully supported by LightStep's
        Customer Success team.
        
        Simply install the agent, configure it to communicate with LightStep
        Satellites, run your app, and then any [frameworks][framework docs], [data stores][datastore docs],
        and [libraries][libs] included in your app will send data to LightStep as distributed traces.
