Description: # niicat
        
        This is a tool to quickly preview nifti images on the terminal. 
        This can be helpful if you are working on a remote server via SSH and do not have
        a -X connection. It uses [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) to display the images.
        Niicat can also display png, jpg or similar images.
        
        
        ### Install:
        
        ```
        pip install niicat
        ```
        
        
        ### Usage:
        
        ```
        niicat T1.nii.gz
        ```
        
        ![](niicat/resources/example.gif)
        
        
        ### Possible problems
        
        If nothing is displayed check if your [terminal supports sixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel#terminal-requirements).
        
        Per default niicat is trying to use libsixel-python. If this is causing problems you can also try using niicat with 
        the option `-ic` if you are using iterm2 (this will use `imgcat` from iterm2) or 
        with the option `-lb` (this will use `libsixel-bin` which can be installed via `sudo apt install libsixel-bin`).
        
        Niicat was only tested on python >= 3.5.
