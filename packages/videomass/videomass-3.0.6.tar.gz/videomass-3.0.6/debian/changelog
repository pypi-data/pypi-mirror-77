videomass (3.0.6-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New stable upstream release
  * The directories `MAcOsxSetup/` and `Win32Setup/` are been unified to 
`FFMPEG/` folder and added to package_data of the videomass3 package.
  * On Linux it is now possible to include ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay 
executables into FFMPEG folder. This could be useful, for instance, to make 
an application bundle all-in-one of Videomass for Linux distros
without ffmpeg installed on (see videomass3/FFMPEG/README).
