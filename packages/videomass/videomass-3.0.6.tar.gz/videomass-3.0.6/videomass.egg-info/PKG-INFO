        Videomass is a cross-platform GUI designed for medium advanced users who
        need to store profiles and automate some conversion processes, but which
        can also be used by beginner users through the use of ready-to-use presets.
        It features graphic tools with high automation capabilities such as PEAK,
        RMS and EBU audio normalization filters with selectable audio stream indexing,
        streams analyzer and more.   
        
        It allows you to create new presets or import/export existing ones, write and
        edit new conversion profiles in order to use [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) 
        without limits of formats, codecs and commands.   
        
        In fact, most of the operations performed with [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) 
        via the command line, can be stored as conversion profiles on Videomass and can 
        be performed or modified on the fly.   
        
        Videomass also offers a graphical interface for the famous video downloader
        [youtube_dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) and allows you to choose 
        between various download options like a specific format codes with the ability 
        to playback individual URLs with different qualities via [mpv](https://mpv.io/) 
        player. Allows also to download all playlist, embed thumbnail in audio file via 
        [atomicparsley](http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/), add metadata to file and 
        write subtitles to video.   
        
        Videomass is written in Python3 with the wxPython-Phoenix toolkit.
