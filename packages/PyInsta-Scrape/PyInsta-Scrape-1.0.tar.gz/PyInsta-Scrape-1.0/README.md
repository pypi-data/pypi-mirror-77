## Documentation
You People Must Have Used A Lot Of Python Libraries But Would Never
Have Seen A Proper Documentation In Maximum Of Them.

**That Is Not With Us (>oo>)**
### Regular Usage
Ok. Now Lets Start By Creating A File Named `main.py:`
The Content Of The File Would Be:
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import PyInsta

result = PyInsta.Insta('username')  # Any Username, You Can Also Use a Vriable
print(result)

```

Now Let's Run This File In The `Terminal:`
```commandline
python main.py
      OR
python3 main.py
```

The Result Will Be:
```shell script
We Have Set The Result Into A Python Dictionary,
So By Printing Just The Result We Get:
{
    'Followers': number_of_followers,
    'Following': number_of_following,
    'Posts': number_of_posts,
    'Name': name
}
```

**Now We Can Access Each Data Seperately Like** `This:`

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import PyInsta

result = PyInsta.Insta('username')  # Any Username, You Can Also Use a Vriable

# This Is Case Sensitive
Followers = result["Followers"]
Following = result["Following"]
Posts = result["Posts"]
Name = result["Name"]

# Now You Can Print These Values Or Use To Make Bots
# Like Telegram Bots And Discord Bots
```

### Usage In Loops
As This Is Python, We Can Use This In Various Ways.
So Let's Create A File Named `loops.py:`
```python
import PyInsta

# Lets Define A List
usernames = ['username1','username2','username3','username4']
# Now We Use The All Known Best Loop:
for username in usernames:
    result = PyInsta.Insta(username)
    print(result)
```

### Mega Usage
Now Based On All The Avobe Information,
We Will Create A Script To Check Multiple 
Accounts.. (UserName Detector)...Create A File `detector.py:`
```python
import PyInsta
usernames = input('Enter Usernames Separated With Space : ').split(' ')

for username in usernames:
    result = PyInsta.Insta(username)
    if "No Such Username" in result:
        pass
    elif "No InterNet Connection" in result:
        print('No InterNet Connection')
        break
    else:
        print(f"""
**-------------------**
Found Live UserName : {username}
**-------------------**
""")
```

Run The File In The `Terminal:`
```commandline
python detector.py
```

The Result Will Be :
```commandline
Enter Usernames Separated With Space : carryminati binod bhubanbam username

**-------------------**
Found Live UserName : carryminati
**-------------------**


**-------------------**
Found Live UserName : binod
**-------------------**


**-------------------**
Found Live UserName : username
**-------------------**


Process finished with exit code 0

```
