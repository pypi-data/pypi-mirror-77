Description: # qdill
        
        a VERY minimal python convenience library for dill
        
        are you **tired** of writing `with open(...) as f` every time you try and use pickle/dill as you're hacking something together in python?
        
        this is the library for you.
        
        it defines some simple functions over dill so that you can just do
        
        `var = qdill.load(filename)`  
        OR  
        `qdill.save(thing, filename)`
        
        There's also a third `defaultLoad` function.  
        
        It checks if the file exists, and if the file doesn't exist, it saves the default thing to the file AND returns the default thing.
        i.e. `var = qdill.defaultLoad(default_thing, filename)`
        
        you can read the code. it's all just ~25 lines in the `__init__.py`
        
        **if you need more fine-grained control of dill...**  
        _Don't use this 'library'_
