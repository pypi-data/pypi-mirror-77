async-Eel
====
Eel is a little Python library for making simple Electron-like offline HTML/JS GUI apps,
with full access to Python capabilities and libraries.

About
----
* Python**3.6+**
* use `asyncio`
* [original README.md](README-old.md)
* [original repository](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel)

I design this library for `asyncio` event loop users.

The original uses `gevent` and both event loops have difficulty in using simultaneously.

Install
----
```bash
pip install async-eel
```

How to use
----
It looks like same usage, but something is different, please look at [example codes](examples).
  
I forked [eel_bootstrap(JP)](https://github.com/namuyan/eel_bootstrap) as good example.
