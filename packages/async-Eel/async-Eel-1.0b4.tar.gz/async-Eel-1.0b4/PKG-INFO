Description: async-Eel
        ====
        Eel is a little Python library for making simple Electron-like offline HTML/JS GUI apps,
        with full access to Python capabilities and libraries.
        
        About
        ----
        * Python**3.6+**
        * use `asyncio`
        * [original README.md](README-old.md)
        * [original repository](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel)
        
        I design this library for `asyncio` event loop users.
        
        The original uses `gevent` and both event loops have difficulty in using simultaneously.
        
        Install
        ----
        ```bash
        pip install async-eel
        ```
        
        How to use
        ----
        It looks like same usage, but something is different, please look at [example codes](examples).
          
        I forked [eel_bootstrap(JP)](https://github.com/namuyan/eel_bootstrap) as good example.
