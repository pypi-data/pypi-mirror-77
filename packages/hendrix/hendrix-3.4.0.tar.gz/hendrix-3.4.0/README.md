## Overview

**hendrix** is a tool for handling bytes-on-the-wire to and from your python web application.  In this sense, it is similar to [mod_wsgi](https://modwsgi.readthedocs.org), [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org), and [gunicorn](http://gunicorn-docs.readthedocs.org).  

However, hendrix differs from these other technologies in that it is natively asynchronous and designed with background tasks in mind.  In this sense, it may serve some projects as a replacement for [gevent](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gevent/) or [celery](http://celery.readthedocs.org).

**hendrix** implements the WSGI protocol, so it can serve applications made with django, pyramid, flask and other WSGI frameworks.  However, hendrix views your web as just another network resource - in fact, this is central to the [hendrix philosophy](http://hendrix.readthedocs.org/en/latest/philosophy/).

Twisted is one of the most battle-tested and actively developed Python projects.  Until hendrix, however, Twisted has not been part of a mainstream python web server.  And that's a shame.

### Features
* **Multi-processing** - The WSGI app can be served from multiple
processes on a single machine.
* **Multi-threading from within your Django / Flask / Pyramid app**: Various APIs allow you to defer logic until later, place it in a different thread or process, and report back asynchronously.  For example, see [crosstown_traffic](http://hendrix.readthedocs.org/en/latest/crosstown_traffic/).
* **Built-in Websockets Framework**
* **Optional Resource Caching**
* **Built-in SSL Support**: Terminate SSL inside your app if you like.  Public keys can be part of your logic!
* **Daemonize** by passing the `-d` or `--daemonize` flags to `hx`

### Quickstart

Using pip

    pip install hendrix


#### Running the Development Server

cd to the directory where your **manage.py** file is located and...

    hx start --dev

This is roughly the equivalent of running the django devserver.
