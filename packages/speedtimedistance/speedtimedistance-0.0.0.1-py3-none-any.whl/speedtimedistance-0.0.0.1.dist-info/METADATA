Description-Content-Type: text/x-rst

'Speedtimedistance' is an advanced tool that has already coded, programmed and prepared with multiple clases and functions using python 3.8.5 in a first-started library version 0.0.0.1; this library is supposed to assist computer scientists,programmers, mathematic students, scholars, and researchers to write their own softwares based on most accurate and standard scientific equations to caculate speed, time, and distance. The first version of this library though may be considerd simple and humble comparing with other scientific tools, but it is good start after all :). All scientific calculations inside this library has already been tested among other standard scientific resourses and convertor-tool applications during conding, and as before publishing and sharing....


Info and Instructions: 

1- Apparently this package contains three different modules .py namely: time, speed, and distance. Every module has its own class and functions, for example: 'time.py ------ Class Time: ------ function caculateTime()', and so on... 

2- Each module has been designed and programmed to stand-alone when called, and each has its own methods and mechanisim to calculate within its own sphere; for example, time module: calculate time, convert time... speed module: calculate speed, convert speed... distance module: caculate distance, convert distance...and so on.. 

3- Error handeling has been considered at the most: probably not covered all errors, but it could be helpful, simplify programming and using the functions when called and when parameter assignments. For example, consider the function: timeUnits() inside time module: time.py: 

- When it is called alone with no parameter, it prints all time units stored in the program: 

1 : s : second
2 : m̲i̲n : minute
3 : h̲r : hour

- Try to enter unwanted parameter like numbers for example it will print an error message with again all time units stored in the program: 

No value has been found in time units
Try again with these values: 

1 : s : second
2 : m̲i̲n : minute
3 : h̲r : hour

No value has been returned yet!

4- All calculations inside the program based on comparison alogorithim, eventhough it looks a large bunch of codes, but it works most accurently and very smart when called and manipulated.
