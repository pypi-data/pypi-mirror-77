        A python package for clap detection
        
        **Platforms Supported:** *Raspberry Pi, Linux, MacOS*
        
        ### Hardware Requirements
        
         * Raspberry Pi
         * Microphone [5]
         * Audio Card [5]
         * Bread Board (optional)
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        **Python 3**
        
         * gpiozero
         * pyaudio ( PortAudio is needed )
         * [munch](https://github.com/Infinidat/munch)
        
        **Other**
        
         * Rasbian OS [3]
         * Audio Driver [1],[2],[3]
        
        ### Setting up Raspberry Pi
        
        1. [Download Raspbian OS](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
        2. Install Raspbian OS in RPi [4]
        3. Plugin the USB input audio device(Audio Card or Microphone)
        4. Configure OS after OS bootup [6] `sudo raspi-config`
        5. Update OS `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
        6. Reboot `sudo reboot` (This should enable the audio driver for the device connected)
        7. Install pip & portaudio module `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip portaudio19-dev`
        8. Install pi-clap pip module `pip3 install pi-clap`
        9. Connect the output line to BCM #4 & #6 Pin on Raspberry Pi.
        
        ( Try 2 claps to activate the output line for 1 sec and 3 claps to toggle ON/OFF state of given PIN. Note: Use 4 claps to exit from the system )
