# NLU : State of the Art Natural Language understanding
John Snow Labs NLU provides state of the art algorithms for NLP&NLU with hundreds of pretrained models in 59 languages.
It enables swift and simple development and research with its powerful Pythonic and Keras inspired API.
NLU's focus liesin providing the latest and greatest results of NLP&NLU research with **1 Line of code at most**
It is powerd by John Snow Labs powerful Spark NLP library.

## Getting Started with NLU
To get your hands on the power of NLU, you just need to install it via pip and ensure Java 8 is installed and properly configured.   

```bash
pip install nlu
```

## Loading and predict with any model in 1 line 
```python
import nlu
nlu.load('sentiment').predict('I love NLU! <3')
```

## Loading and predict with  <u>multiple models</u> in 1 line

Get 6 different embeddings in 1 line and use them for downstream datas cience tasks!

```python
nlu.load('bert elmo albert xlnet glove use').predict('I love NLU! <3')
```

## What kind of models does NLU provides?
NLU provides everything a data scientist might want to wish for in one line of code!    

- The 14+ of the latest NLP embeddings ( BERT, ELMO, ALBERT, XLNET, GLOVE, BIOBERT, USE) and different varaitions of them
- Generation of Sentence, Chunk and Document from these embeddings
- Language Classification of 20 languages
- NER models for 50  languages
- Part of Speech (POS) models for 34  languages
- Lemmatizers models for 34  languages
- Sentiment models for 5 categories
- Labeld and Unlabled Dependency parsing
- Spell Checking
- Stopword removers for 41  languages
- Classifiesr for 12 different problems
- <u>**244 unique**</u>  NLU components
- <u>**176 uniqe**</u> NLP models and algorithns
- <u>**68 unique**</u> NLP pipelines consisting of composed NLP models
