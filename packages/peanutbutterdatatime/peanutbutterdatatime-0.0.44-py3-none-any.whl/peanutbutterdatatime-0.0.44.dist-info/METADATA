# NLU : State of the Art Natural Language understanding
John Snow Labs NLU provides state of the art algorithms for NLP&NLU with hundreds of pretrained models in 59 languages.
It enables swift and simple development and research with its powerful Pythonic and Keras inspired API.
NLU's focus liesin providing the latest and greatest results of NLP&NLU research with **1 Line of code at most**
It is powerd by John Snow Labs powerful Spark NLP library.

## Getting Started with NLU
To get your hands on the power of NLU, you just need to install it via pip and ensure Java 8 is installed and properly configured.   

```bash
pip install nlu
```
