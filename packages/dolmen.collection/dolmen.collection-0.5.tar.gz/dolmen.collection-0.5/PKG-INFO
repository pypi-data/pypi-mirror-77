        dolmen.collection
        =================
        
        Dolmen collection offers a collection implementation which permits to 
        manipulate named elements: arrange order, extract part of the collection,
        enforce a type of component and add new ones easily.
        
        It originated from zeam.form where it was used to implement forms as 
        collections of fields, actions and widgets.
