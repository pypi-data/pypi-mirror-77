> **PSA:** Big changes are coming in RepoBee 3, which is slated for release
> August 31st. We are overhauling both the CLI and the plugin system to
> dramatically simplify both. Many of these changes are **breaking** in regards
> to RepoBee 2.4. It is unfortunate, but we need to make a clean break with
> RepoBee 2 in order to create a much better solution for all users.
>
> In conjunction with the release of RepoBee 3, we will publish a 2-to-3 guide
> for those who are familiar with RepoBee 2. The core concepts all remain the
> same, so the transition should not be difficult.

## Overview
RepoBee is a command line tool that allows teachers and teaching assistants
to administrate large amounts of Git repositories on the GitHub and GitLab
platforms (cloud and self-hosted). The most basic use case is to automate
generation of student repositories based on _master_ (i.e. template)
repositories, that can contain for example instructions and skeleton code. Given
one or more master repositories, generating copies of these for students or
groups is a single command away! That is however just scratching the surface:
RepoBee also has functionality for updating student repos (maybe you forgot
something?), batch cloning of student repos (convenient when correcting tasks),
giving students read-only access to other students' repos for peer review, and
more at that! There is also a [plugin
system](https://github.com/repobee/repobee-plug) in place that allows Python
programmers to expand RepoBee in various ways, and end users can simply install
plugins created by others. An example of such a plugin is
[`repobee-junit4`](https://github.com/repobee/repobee-junit4), which runs
teacher-defined JUnit4 test classes on Java code in cloned student repos.

RepoBee is currently being used for the introductory courses in computer science at
[KTH Royal Technical Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs). The
courses have roughly 200 students and several thousands of repositories,
allowing us to test RepoBee at quite a large scale.

### Citing RepoBee in an academic context
If you want to reference RepoBee in a paper, please cite the following paper:

> Simon LarsÃ©n and Richard Glassey. 2019. RepoBee: Developing Tool Support for
> Courses using Git/GitHub. In Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Conference on
> Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE '19). ACM,
> New York, NY, USA, 534-540. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3304221.3319784

### Feature highlights
* Compatible with both GitHub and GitLab (both cloud and self-hosted)
* Generate repositories for students based on master (template) repositories
* Clone student repositories in batches
* Peer review features: give students read access to other students'
  repositories to do code review. Easily revoke read access once reviews are
  done.
* Support for group assignments (multiple students per repository)
* Open, close and list issues for select student repositories
* Extend RepoBee with the
  [plugin system](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html)
* Very little configuration required on the GitHub/GitLab side
    - The only requirement is to have an Organization/Group with private repository
      capabilities!
* No local configuration required
    - Although [setting a few defaults](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#configuration)
      is highly recommended

### Install
RepoBee is on PyPi, so `python3 -m pip install repobee` should do the trick. See the
[install instructions](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)
for more elaborate instructions.

### Getting started
The best way to get started with RepoBee is to head over to the
[Docs](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), where you (among other
things) will find the
[user guide](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userguide.html).
It covers the use of RepoBee's varous commands by way of practical example,
and should set you on the right path with little effort.

## Why RepoBee?
RepoBee was developed at KTH Royal Technical Institute of Technology to help
teachers and TAs administrate GitHub repositories. It's a tool for teachers, by
teachers, and we use it in our everyday work. All of the features in RepoBee
are being actively used by us, and so should also be useful to other teachers.
For newcomers, RepoBee offers an opinionated workflow that is easy to adopt,
while the more advanced users can utilize the plugin system to augment their
experience. We also recognize that lock-in is a problem, and therefore provide
compatibility with both GitHub and GitLab, with hopes of also expanding support
to Bitbucket at some point. But what you're really looking for is probably what
RepoBee can do, so below is a complete list of RepoBee's functionality as
described by the `--help` option (plugins not included!).

```
$ repobee -h
usage: repobee [-h] [-v]
                {show-config,setup,update,migrate,clone,open-issues,
                 close-issues,list-issues,assign-reviews,
                 end-reviews,check-reviews,verify-settings}
                ...

## Roadmap
As of December 17th 2018, RepoBee's CLI is a stable release and adheres to
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The internals
of RepoBee _do not_ adhere to this versioning, so using RepoBee as a library
is not recommended.

The plugin system is considered to be in the alpha phase, as it has seen much
less live action use than the rest of the CLI. Features are highly unlikely to
be cut, but hooks may be modified as new use-cases arise as the internals of
RepoBee need to be altered. **If you develop a plugin, please get in touch so
that can be taken into consideration if breaking changes are introduced to the
plugin system**.

The plugin system is planned for stable release along with RepoBee 3.0 in
summer 2020.

### Upcoming features
RepoBee 3.0 is slated for release summer 2020, and will be accompanied by major
features such as on-the-fly preprocessing of master repositories before pushing
to student repositories, and automatic discovery of both student teams and
student repositories.
