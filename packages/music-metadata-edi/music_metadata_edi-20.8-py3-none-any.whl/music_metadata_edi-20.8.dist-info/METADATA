Music Metadata - EDI is a base library for several EDI-based formats by CISAC, most 
notably Common Works Registration (CWR) and Common Royalty Distribution (CRD).

This library features common (abstract) functionality. You may test it online, no 
coding skills required: https://music-metadata.herokuapp.com/

The code for this demo is here: https://github.com/musicmetadata/web-wrapper, it
can easily be deployed to a free Heroku account.

Libraries for concrete formats are under development, their release schedule depends 
on sponsors. 

Finished, but not yet released functionality can be tested in a custom demo: https://web-wrapper.matijakolaric.com/

## CWR 2.x

Currently, CWR 2.1 parsing, validation, and conversions to multiple formats (JSON, Excel, CSV)
are mature, but not fully sponsored yet. CWR 2.2 is in alpha, due to lack of real-life example files.

Sponsors get the finished code immediately, so if you need CWR parsing and validation and more. 

CWR 2.x generation is under development, could be finished quickly if funding was found.
