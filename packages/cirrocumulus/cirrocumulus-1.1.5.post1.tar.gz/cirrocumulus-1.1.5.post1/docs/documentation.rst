Overview
^^^^^^^^^

The Cirrocumulus interface is described below:

.. image:: images/overview.png

The left panel specifies the embedding and attributes of cells to visualize, as well as marker configurations.
All the plots are shown in the main window on its right-hand side, while the top panel is mainly to set the current user and dataset.


Open Dataset - Shared Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, if you're running in a shared environment, sign in to your Google account by clicking the ``SIGN IN`` button on the right-top corner:

.. image:: images/sign-in.png
  :align: center

After that, select the dataset you want to visualize from the drop-down menu on the top panel:

.. image:: images/choose-dataset.png
  :scale: 50%
  :align: center

Open Dataset - Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 cirro launch <path_to_dataset>

- Datasets can be provided in h5ad, loom, or STAR-Fusion formats.
- Launch accepts more than one dataset to support cases in which modalities are stored in separate files.
- Marker lists can be provided in JSON format to quickly load features from predefined lists.



View Embedding and Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After opening the dataset, you need to specify which embedding and cell attributes you want to see on the left panel:

.. image:: images/embed-attr.png
  :scale: 50%
  :align: center

Here is the detailed explanation on each field:

* **Embedding**: You can choose cell embeddings here for visualization. The embedding name indicates its algorithm:
e.g. ``X_umap`` is for UMAP coordinates, ``X_fitsne`` for FIt-SNE, ``X_fle`` for force-directed layout, etc.
Select multiple embeddings two view more than one embedding simultaneously.

* **Features**: You can view feature plots by selecting genes from this field. Either choose from the drop-down menu,
or type in this field, with candidate genes provided while you are typing, and select the gene you want. You can also
paste a list of genes from your clipboard or drop a file with one gene per line.

* **Observations**: Cell attributes can be chosen from this field to view.

Main plot view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default view is a main interactive embedding plot, as the example below:

.. image:: images/interactive-plot.png
  :align: center

You can scroll your mouse to zoom in/out the main plot. Use the toolbox on the left-top side to change the active tool:

.. image:: images/toolbox.png
  :align: center

From left to right are: *Lasso selection*, *Box selection*, *Append to selection*, *Move viewpoint*, *Save to image*, and *View Gallery*.

By default, *Move viewpoint* is activated, and you can move the viewpoint by dragging your cursor on the main plot.
You can select a specific area to view by switching to one of the three selections provided in the toolbox.
By clicking *Save to image* button, you can save the current plot as a png or svg file. The last *View Gallery* button
scrolls to the Gallery view.

As the main plot is interactive, you can see the attribute of each data point (i.e. cell) by moving your cursor to its location on the plot.

You can also select cells with the same status by clicking the corresponding name from legend:

.. image:: images/legend-select.png
  :align: center

As a result, this specific group of cells is highlighted. You can click the same name once more to go back to the normal plot.

You can adjust the main plot using the view options on the left panel:

.. image:: images/view-options.png
  :scale: 50%
  :align: center

Mouse behavior for the main plot is:

- 3-d plot:

  - Rotate: Mouse left click
  - Pan: Mouse right click
  - Zoom: Mouse wheel


- 2-d plot

  - Pan: Mouse left click.
  - Zoom: Mouse wheel.

Gallery view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The gallery view, which is displayed below the main plot, shows all selected features and embeddings:

.. image:: images/gallery.png
  :align: center

As you can see from the example above, gallery view provides a way for comparing plots. The legend can be viewed in the left-side panel.

Additionally, when you select a specific class of cells, you'll see that all the plots have these cells highlighted:

.. image:: images/gallery-select.png
  :align: center

You can also change the gallery plots' size using the following option on the left panel:

.. image:: images/gallery-chart-size.png
  :scale: 50%
  :align: center


Dot plot view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to embeddings, you can also view gene distributions across cell categories using dot plots:

.. image:: images/dot-plot.png
  :align: center

You can switch to this view by selecting ``Dot Plot`` from the top tab.


Share Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, you can share plots with your collaborators by clicking the left-most button on the right-top corner, and choosing ``Copy Link`` from the drop-down menu:

.. image:: images/more.png
  :scale: 50%
  :align: center

Now you can send the URL you just copied to others.
