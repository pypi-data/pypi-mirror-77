`PyADTS` is aimed at accelerating the workflow of time series anomaly detection for researchers. It contains various utilities for data loading, pre-processing, detector construction, detector ensemble, evaluation and etc. `PyADTS` can help you to write less boilerplate on following parts:

- Preparing dataset & pre-processing
- Feature extraction (Optional)
- Model training
- Ensemble (Optional)
- Evaluation

You can find the complete [documentation](https://pyadts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) here.

## Installation
To install the package locally, run:

```bash
>> cd <pyadts_dir>
>> pip install .
```

To install the package from PyPi, run:

```bash
>> pip install pyadts
```

## Quick Start

### Fetch the dataset

`PyADTS` contains various built-in datasets. To utilize them:

```python
from pyadts.data import get_nab_nyc_taxi

data = get_nab_nyc_taxi(root_path='<the_path_of_nab_dataset>')
```

All components of the dataset are organized as a dict:

`{'value': value, 'label': label, 'timestamp': timestamp, 'datetime': datetime}`

### Pre-processing

It's important to pre-process the time series before training. `PyADTS` offered three types of pre-processing methods including:

- Rearrangement: Sort the values along with the timestamp and reconstruct the timestamp to discover missing values. (return a dict and append an attribute `missing`)
- Normalization: Normalize the time series
- Imputation: Impute the time series.

```python
from pyadts.data import series_impute, series_normalize, series_rearrange

data_processed = series_rearrange(**data)

data_processed['value'] = series_normalize(data_processed['value'], mask=data_processed['missing'], method='zscore')

data_processed['value'] = series_impute(data_processed['value'], missing=data_processed['missing'], method='linear')
```

### Feature extraction

Extracting manual features is essential for some anomaly detection approaches. `PyADT` offered various options for extracting features including:

- Simple features: logarithm, difference, second-order difference, ...
- Window-based features: window mean value, window std value, ...
- Decomposition features: STL decomposition, ...
- Frequency domain features: wavelet features, spectral residual, ...
- Regression features: SARIMA regression residual, Exponential Smoothing residual, ...

```python
from pyadts.data import FeatureExtractor

feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()
```

### Train the model

Different anomaly detection algorithms should be utilized to tackle different scenarios. `PyADT` contains various algorithms including supervised-, unsupervised-, nonparametric-methods (you can refer the full list of [implemented algorithms](#implemented-algorithms)).

```python
from pyadts import ThresholdDetector

train_x = data['value']
detector = ThresholdDetector()
pred_y = detector.fit_predict(train_x)
```

### Ensemble

TODO

### Evaluation

It's easy to evaluate your algorithms using `PyADT`'s built-in metrics:

```python
from pyadts import roc_auc

train_y = data['label']
roc = roc_auc(pred_y, train_y, delay=7)
```

In real-world applications, the delay of anomaly alerts is acceptable. So `PyADT` offered the `delay` argument for all metrics.

### The pipeline

TODO

## Other Utilities

### Visualization

You can visualize your data with a single line of code:

```python
from pyadts.data import plot_series

fig = plot_series(value=data['value'], label=data['label'], datetime=data['datetime'], plot_vline=True)
fig.show()
```
