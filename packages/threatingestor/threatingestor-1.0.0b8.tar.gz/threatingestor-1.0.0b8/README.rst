An extendable tool to extract and aggregate IOCs_ from threat feeds.

Integrates out-of-the-box with ThreatKB_ and MISP_, and can fit seamlessly into any existing worflow with SQS_, Beanstalk_, and `custom plugins`_.

Currently used by InQuest Labs IOC-DB: https://labs.inquest.net/iocdb.

Overview
--------

ThreatIngestor can be configured to watch Twitter, RSS feeds, or other sources, extract meaningful information such as malicious IPs/domains and YARA signatures, and send that information to another system for analysis.

Installation
------------

ThreatIngestor requires Python 3.6+, with development headers.

Install ThreatIngestor from PyPI::

    pip install threatingestor

Install optional dependencies for using some plugins, as needed::

    pip install threatingestor[all]

View the `full installation instructions`_ for more information.

Usage
-----

Create a new ``config.yml`` file, and configure each source and operator module you want to use. (See ``config.example.yml`` for layout.) Then run the script::

    threatingestor config.yml

By default, it will run forever, polling each configured source every 15 minutes.

View the `full ThreatIngestor documentation`_ for more information.

Threat Intel Sources
--------------------

Looking for some threat intel sources to get started? InQuest has a Twitter List with several accounts that post C2 domains and IPs: https://twitter.com/InQuest/lists/ioc-feed. Note that you will need to apply for a Twitter developer account to use the ThreatIngestor Twitter Source. Take a look at ``config.example.yml`` to see how to set this list up as a source.

For quicker setup, RSS feeds can be a great source of intelligence. Check out this example `RSS config file`_ for a few pre-configured security blogs.

Support
-------

If you need help getting set up, or run into any issues, feel free to open an Issue_. You can also reach out to `@InQuest`_ on Twitter.
