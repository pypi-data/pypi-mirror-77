============
CRM Helpdesk
============

Like records and processing of claims, Helpdesk and Support are good tools to
trace your interventions. This menu is more adapted to oral communication,
which is not necessarily related to a claim. Select a customer, add notes
and categorize your interventions with a channel and a priority level.
