### typo_pypi, experimental methods 

*insert a UML diagram for all classes*  
analizer: forms list from  package managers  
validater: checks typos for any squats or malicious code
server: handles http stuff  
algos: mostly levenshtein delete-insert typo generation

* should back theoretical claims in thesis work
* could be used for a possible API used by a standalone security pypi module 
* a yet pretty slow and naive implementation
