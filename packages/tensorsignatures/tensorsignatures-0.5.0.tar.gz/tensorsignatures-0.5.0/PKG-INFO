        TensorSignatures is a tensor factorisation framework for mutational signature analysis, which in contrast to other methods, deciphers mutational processes not only in terms of mutational spectra, but also assess their properties with respect to various genomic variables, allows the inclusion of different mutation types and integrates a robust noise model toperform the inference.
        
        *TensorSignatures is a young project and breaking changes are to be expected. We keep a changelog and it will have possible breakage clearly documented.*
        
        *************
        Quick install
        *************
        
        TensorSignatures makes use of the TensorFlow 1.5.x framework requiring the user to install a separate package to enable GPU support, i.e. :code:`tensorflow-gpu` instead of :code:`tensorflow`. We highly recommend to install TensorSignatures into an environment with tensorflow-gpu, as the tensor computations greatly benefit from GPU-acceleration.
        
        Via GitHub
        ==========
        
        To obtain the most recent version of TensorSignatures, we recommend to download the repository directly from GitHub and to install the package into a virtual environment. To get started, clone the repository by executing the following commands in your terminal
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/gerstung-lab/tensorsignatures.git && cd tensorsignatures
        
        Then, create a new virtual environment and install all dependencies. If you have access to a GPU with cuda support use :code:`requirements-gpu.txt` instead of :code:`requirements.txt`.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python -m venv env
            $ source env/bin/activate
            $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel && pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Finally, install TensorSignatures.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Via Pypi
        ========
        
        To install :code:`tensorsignatures` via Pypi simply type
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install tensorsignatures
        
        into your shell.
        
        Via docker (& jupyter)
        ======================
        
        To run TensorSignatures within a docker environment, clone the repository
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/gerstung-lab/tensorsignatures.git
            $ cd tensorsignatures
        
        and spin up the container using :code:`docker-compose`
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ docker-compose up --build
        
        This spins up a jupyter server including notebooks with tutorials on http://localhost:8889.

        ***************
        Getting started
        ***************
        
        
        Step 1: Data preparation
        ========================
        
        Running TensorSignatures involves three steps: preparing the input data, i.e. creating the mutation count tensor as well as the mutation count matrix, computing a trinucleotide normalisation to account for differences in the nucleotide composition of different genomic regions, and running TensorSignatures.
        
        Preparing input data using docker
        ---------------------------------
        
        We provide a docker image that contains all :code:`R` and :code:`bioconductor` dependencies to create the variant tensor and the other mutation type matrix. To use it, pull the image from docker. Note that the image is approximately 5 GB large.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ docker pull sagar87/tensorsignatures-data:latest
        
        To use the image switch into the folder containing your VCF data. Then run image using the following command and supply the VCF files as well as the name of the :code:`hdf5` output file (must be the last argument) as arguments.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ docker run -v $PWD:/usr/src/app sagar87/tensorsignatures-data <vcf1.vcf> <vcf2.vcf> ... <vcfn.vcf> <output.h5>
        
        Then continue with Step 2.
        
        Preparing input data using a custom installation
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        Make sure you have :code:`R3.4.x` (!) and the packages :code:`VariantAnnotation` and :code:`rhdf5` installed. You can install them, if necessary, by executing
        
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ Rscript -e "source('https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R'); biocLite('VariantAnnotation')"
        
        and
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ Rscript -e "source('https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R'); biocLite('rhdf5')"
        
        from your command line.
        
        To get started, download the following files and place them in the same directory:
        
        `Constants.RData <http://193.62.55.163/file/R/constants.RData>`_ (contains :code:`GRanges` objects that annotate transcription/replication orientation, nucleosomal and epigenetic states)
        
        `mutations.R <http://193.62.55.163/file/R/mutations.R>`_ (all required functions to partiton SNVs, MNVs and indels)
        
        `processVcf.R <http://193.62.55.163/file/R/processVcf.R>`_ (loads :code:`vcf` files and creates the SNV count tensor, MNV and indel count matrix; eventually needs custom modification to make the script run on your vcfs.)
        
        `genome.zip <http://193.62.55.163/file/R/genome.zip>`_ .
        
        
        To obtain the SNV count tensor and the matrices containing other mutation types, execute :code:`processVcf.R` and pass the VCF files you want to convert, as well as a name for an output :code:`hdf5` file as command line arguments, e.g.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ Rscript processVcf.R <vcf1.vcf> <vcf2.vcf> ... <vcfn.vcf> <output.h5>
        
        In case of errors please check wether you have correctly specified paths in line 6-8. Also, take a look at the :code:`readVcfSave` function and adjust it when it fails.
        
        Step 2: Computing trinucleotide normalisation
        =============================================
        
        TensorSignatures requires a trinucleotide normalisation constant to account for differences in the nucleotide composition of genomic states. To compute it, invoke the prep sub routine of TensorSignatures and pass the :code:`hd5` file from Step 1 as well as the path for the output file as positional arguments to the programme.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ tensorsignatures prep <output.h5> <tsdata.h5>
        
        
        Step 3: Run TensorSignatures
        ============================
        
        There are two ways to run TensorSignatures using either the :code:`refit` option, which fits the exposures of a set of pre-defined signatures extracted from the PCAWG cohort to a your dataset, or via the :code:`train` subroutine, that performs a denovo extraction of tensor signatures. Refitting tensor signatures is computationally fast but does not allow to discover new signatures, while extracting new signatures from scratch is computationally intensive (GPU required) and requires ideally larger numbers of samples. For most use cases, with a small number of samples, we advice to use the refit option:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ tensorsignatures --verbose refit tsData.h5 refit.pkl -n
        
        To run a denovo extraction use
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ tensorsignatures --verbose train tsData.h5 denovo.pkl <rank> -k <size> -n -ep <epochs>
        
        
        where :code:`rank` specifies the decomposition rank, :code:`size` controls the dispersion of the model, and :code:`epochs` the number of desired epochs to fit the model. TensorSignatures outputs value of the objective function (log likelihood) that is minimised during training as well as the change of the objective during an epoch interval (:code:`delta`). When deciding on the number of epochs to train the model ensure that it is sufficiently large such that the objective function converges, i.e. the :code:`delta` value is close to, or fluctuates around zero. For more information on how to run TensorSignatures in a practical setting see the documentation. Running TensorSignatures will yield a pickle dump which can subsequently inspected using the tensorsignatures package.
