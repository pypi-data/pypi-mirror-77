Installation instructions
=========================

Requirements
------------

The :mod:`cnnclustering` package is developed and tested in Python 3.8. Earlier
versions >=3.6 may work as well, though. The package has a few third
party Python package dependencies. We recommend to install the latest
version of:

   * :mod:`matplotlib`
   * :mod:`numpy`
   * :mod:`scipy`
   * :mod:`pandas` (optional)
   * :mod:`tqdm`
   * :mod:`PyYAML`

If you want to compile the Cython extensions yourself, you will need to
install :mod:`Cython` as well. The tests can be run after installing
:mod:`pytest` and require :mod:`scikit-learn`.

PyPi
----

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install cnnclustering
