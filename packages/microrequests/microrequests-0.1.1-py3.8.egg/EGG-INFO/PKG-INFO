Description: microrequests
        =============
        
        This module makes consuming microservices in python more efficient.
        Python’s requests module is fantastic and highly configurable,
        microrequests builds a wrapper over requests module and enables
        connection pooling as part of initialisation. This ensures that you use
        the same connection instead of creating one with every new request,
        while still working with requests’ clean APIs and mechanism.
        
        This is first version of microrequests and we intend to add more
        customisation for to consume microservices easily and efficiently.
        
        To use, simply do::
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import microrequests
        
            mr = microrequests.init()
            res = mr.get("http://httpbin.org") # mr is requests' session object and you can use it in similar manner
            print(res.text) 
        
        you can also customize max\_retries, pool\_connections and pool\_maxsize
        - they are by default set to 1, 100 and 50 respectively
        pool\_connections is the number of urllib3 connection pools to cache and
        poolmaxsize\* is the maximum number of connections to save in the pool
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import microrequests
        
            mr = microrequests.init(max_retries=2, pool_connections=10, pool_size=5)
            res = mr.get("http://httpbin.org")
            print(res.text)
        
        To run tests:
        
        ``$ tox``
