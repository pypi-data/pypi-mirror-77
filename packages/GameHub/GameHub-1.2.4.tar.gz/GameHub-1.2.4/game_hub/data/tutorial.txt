You pick the slot you want to pick using a number. Each number
on the board corresponds to the number that you have to press
to pick that slot. The board looks like this:

    1  2  3
    4  5  6
    7  8  9

Here we'll show an example game so you don't get confused

Player one it's your turn!

Player one: 3

    1  2  X
    4  5  6
    7  8  9

Player 2 it's your turn!
