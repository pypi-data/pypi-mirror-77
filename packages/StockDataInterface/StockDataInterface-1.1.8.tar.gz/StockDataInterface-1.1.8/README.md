# About

A fast, easy API that retrieves stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Data can be initialized by scraping data from yahoo finance or by reading from a json file saved by a previous session.
Data collected includes current data as well as all historical data for a stock up to the past 50 years.
Unlike other APIs that collect data from Yahoo Finance this API has built in easy to use functions to filter collected data.

# Installation

```shell
$ pip install StockDataInterface
```

---

# Examples

below are a couple code samples, for a complete list of funtions available consult the [documentation](#Documentation) 

 ```python
 #Nick Latham
 #8/7/2020
 #print and plot the close data of Apple from the past year

from StockDataInterface import api 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #(pip install matplotlib)

#first initialize the stock
api.initializStockData("AAPL")

#get the historical data from the past year
data = api.getHistoricalDataRangeOfDates("AAPL", "2019-08-07", "2020-08-07")

#get the close data into an array using the 'close' key
#keys available are 'open', 'low', 'close', 'high', 'volume', 'adjclose', and 'date'
closeData = data['close']

#we need to reverse the array because historical data is returned from most recent to least recent
closeData.reverse()

#plot and show the graph
plt.plot(closeData)
plt.show()

 ```

 ```python
 #Nick Latham
 #8/7/2020
 #compare close prices from Delta and United Airlines from the past 30 trading days

from StockDataInterface import api 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#initialize the data
api.initializStockData("DAL")
api.initializStockData("UAL")

#get the data from the past 30 trading days
dataDAL = api.getHistoricalDataPast30TradingDays("DAL")
dataUAL = api.getHistoricalDataPast30TradingDays("UAL")

#only get the close data
closeDataDAL = dataDAL['close']
closeDataUAL = dataUAL["close"]

#reverse the arrays since we get the data from most recent to least recent
closeDataDAL.reverse()
closeDataUAL.reverse()

#plot  and show the data
plt.plot(closeDataDAL)
plt.plot(closeDataUAL)
plt.show()
 ```
