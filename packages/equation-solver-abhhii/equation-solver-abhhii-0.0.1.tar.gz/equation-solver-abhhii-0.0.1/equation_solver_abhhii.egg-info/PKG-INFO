Description: # Equation Solver
        
        This package can be used to solve linear equations encode in JSON.
        Sample format is given below:  
        
        ```
        {
            "op": "equal",
            "lhs": {
                "op": "add",
                "lhs": 1,
                "rhs": {
                    "op": "multiply",
                    "lhs": "x",
                    "rhs": 10
                }
            },
            "rhs": 21
        }
        
        ```
