It is to record\neach daily visit to a site.\n\nThe one additional factor is that it will record a single daily visit per session / device / ip\ncombination. This means that if a user visits a site multiple times from the same location / same\ndevice, without logging out, then they will be recorded once. If the same user logs in from a\ndifferent device, IP address, then they will be recorded again.\n\nThe goal is to record unique daily visits per user 'context' ( where context is the location /\ndevice combo).\n\nAdmin list view:\n\n![UserVisit list view](assets/screenshot-admin-list-view.png)\n\nAdmin edit view:\n\n![UserVisit edit view](assets/screenshot-admin-edit-view.png)\n",
