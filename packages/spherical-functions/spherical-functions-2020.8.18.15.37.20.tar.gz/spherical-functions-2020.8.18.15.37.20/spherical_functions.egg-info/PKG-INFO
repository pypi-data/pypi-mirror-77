Description: Python/numba package for evaluating and transforming Wigner's 𝔇 matrices, Wigner's 3-j symbols, and
        spin-weighted (and scalar) spherical harmonics. These functions are evaluated directly in terms of
        quaternions, as well as in the more standard forms of spherical coordinates and Euler angles.
