Zou is the memory of your CG production
---------------------------------------

Zou is an API that stores and manages data related to Animation productions. It allows you to centralize 
and access to all your data. Your tools connect to it and query the data from your production. Your 
Artists manage their files and their tasks more efficiently. It helps them to spend more time on the 
artistic side. 

A dedicated Python client, `Gazu <https://gazu.cg-wire.com>`_, allows users to integrate Zou into the tools.
