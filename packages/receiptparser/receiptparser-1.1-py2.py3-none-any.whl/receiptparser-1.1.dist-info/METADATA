## Summary

A receipt and bill parser written in Python.
Can be used as a Python module or CLI tool.

It was originally based on [receipt-parser](https://github.com/mre/receipt-parser),
but has effectively been completely rewritten/replaced.

So far, only German receipts are supported, but other countries can
be added using a simple [YAML configuration file](receiptparser/data/configs/germany.yml).

## Recognition rate

To develop this tool, I used a set of 182 receipts in varying quality. Some of the were
crumpled, most had been folded, etc. The result on this set of receipts is:

```
Total:             182
Company found:     171
Postal code found: 158
Date found:        159
Amount found:      114
```

If your receipts are sharp, uncrumpled, and have good contrast, I would expect a
97%-99% success rate, except for the total amount, which is harder to identify
correctly. That may be closer to 75%.

Where applicable, I chose automation and quality over performance. For example,
receiptparser scans every image twice, once unsharpened, and once sharpened,
which raises the recognition rate around 6% but doubles the scan time.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- PIP3
- tesseract

### Install via PIP


```bash
pip3 install receiptparser
```

### Install via Git

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .
```


## Python usage

```python
from receiptparser.config import read_config
from receiptparser.parser import process_receipt

config = read_config('my_config.yml')
receipt = process_receipt(config, "my_receipt.jpg", out_dir=None, verbosity=0)

print("Filename:   ", receipt.filename)
print("Company:    ", receipt.company)
print("Postal code:", receipt.postal)
print("Date:       ", receipt.date)
print("Amount:     ", receipt.sum)
```

## CLI Usage


### Examples

A simple example to read all images (.jpg) from a directory and print the recognized data
to stdout:

```bash
receiptparser tests/data/germany/img/
```

You can customize the output as follows:

```bash
receiptparser -v0 --format "{date:%Y-%m-%d} - {company} - {postal} - {sum}.jpg" tests/data/germany/img/
```

In this case, `-v0` suppresses any output, except for what you specify in the `--format FORMAT`
parameter. FORMAT is a Python format string as specified [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#format-string-syntax).
The following values can be used in the format string:

- company: The recognized name of the company
- postal: The recognized postal code of the company
- date: The recognized date of the bill or receipt
- sum: The dollar (or Euro, or other currency) amount of the bill or receipt

### Syntax

```bash
usage: receiptparser [-h] [-c CONFIG] [--config-file CONFIG_FILE] [-t TESSERACT] [-f FORMAT] [-v {0,1,2}] input

positional arguments:
  input                 file or directory from which images will be read

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        built-in config to use
  --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        like -c, but point to a file instead
  -t TESSERACT, --tesseract TESSERACT
                        output directory for OCR recognized text (default is to discard)
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                        format of the recognized output. default is pretty-printing
  -v {0,1,2}, --verbosity {0,1,2}
                        increase output verbosity
```
