Description: # TimeAndPlace API & CLI Application

        This repo contains both a Python3 API, and a command-line application for interacting with [@salamander2](https://github.com/salamander2)'s [TimeAndPlace](https://github.com/salamander2/TimeAndPlace) service over a network. The main reason behind this package is for use in another project I have planned for room occupancy tracking.
        
        ## What kind of data can be accessed?
        
        Currently, this is mostly a Read-Only API. The following data can be accessed when logged in:
         - List of all student IDs
         - A particular student's info
         - Student location tracking **\***
        
        **\*** This data can be written via the API
        
        ## CLI usage
        
        The command-line app uses "action commands" in the format of:
        
        ```sh
        timeandplace --username <username> --password <password> <action> [optional: --endpoint <url>]
        ```
        
        A list of possible actions can be viewed by running:
        
        ```sh
        timeandplace help
        ```
        
        ## API usage
        
        All interaction is done via the `TimeAndPlace` object. It has the following methods:
        
        ```python
        client = TimeAndPlace()
        client.login(str, str)
        
        # These require login to be called
        client.getStudentInfo(int) -> StudentInfo
        client.getAllStudents() -> List[int]
        client.getAllCourses() -> List[CourseInfo]
        client.signInStudentToTerminal(int, int)
        client.signOutStudentFromTerminal(int, int)
        ```
        
        I recommend taking a look at the [single source file](https://github.com/Ewpratten/timeandplace-api/blob/master/timeandplace/__init__.py) for more info on the API.
