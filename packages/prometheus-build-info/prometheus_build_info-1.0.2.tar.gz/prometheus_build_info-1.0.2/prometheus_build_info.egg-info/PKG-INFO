Description: # Prometheus BuildInfo
        Python library for adding a buildinfo metric to your Prometheus-enabled applications.
        
        ## Usage
        ### Installation
        
            pip install prometheus-build-info
            
        ### make-build-info utility
        
        The make-build-info utility can be used during building or packaging to create a build_info.json file that stores the
        relevant build information that this library publishes. 
        
            make-build-info --help
            Usage: make-build-info [OPTIONS] APPNAME BRANCH REVISION VERSION
        
            Options:
              --help  Show this message and exit.
        
        Alternatively, running the utility when environment variables exist with the same name as the arguments listed above will
        have the same effect.
        
        ### Manual creation of build_info.json
        
        If this suits your build process better, you can manually create build_info.json during the build. It has the following 
        format:
        
            {
            "appname": "test_app",
            "branch": "master",
            "revision": "abcdef",
            "version": "1.0.1"
            }
            
        ### Adding the metric to your app
        
        Ensure that build_info.json is in your application working directory. Import ```prometheus_build_info.info``` into a code file that will be run during or after application initialisation.
