        Python 3 package for fast text matching and replacing.
        
        This library implements two fast approaches for matching keywords/gazetteer entries:
        * TokenMatcher: keywords/gazetteer entries are sequences of tokens, optionally associated with some data and 
          the matcher tries to match any of those in a given sequence of tokens. 
        * StringMatcher: keywords/gazetter entries are strings, optionally associated with some data and 
          the matcher tries to match any of those in a given string, optionally only at non-word boundaries.
        
        The matchers are implemented to be fast: TokenMatcher is a hash tree, StringMatcher uses a
        character trie implementation underneath. Both matchers implement additional features often required in NLP:
        
        * return the offsets in the original iterable where a match occurs
        * mapfunc: tokens/characters can be mapped to some canonical form that is used for matching
        * ignorefunc: some tokens/characters can be entirely ignored for matching
        * match all/longest: only match the longest entry versus all entries
        * skip/noskip: if any match is found, continue matching after the longest match versus at the next position
