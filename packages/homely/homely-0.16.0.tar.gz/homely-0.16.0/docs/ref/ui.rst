homely.ui
=========


homely.ui.head()
----------------

Use ``head("some text")`` to display a nice heading in homely's output.
``head()`` should be used as a context manager so that log output is indented
correctly::

    import os
    from os.path import join, isdir
    from homely.ui import head
    from homely.system import execute

    with head('Doing git fetches'):
        src = join(os.environ['HOME'], 'src')
        for entry in os.listdir(src):
            path = join(src, entry)
            if isdir(path):
                execute(['git', 'fetch', '-p'], cwd=path)


homely.ui.warn()
----------------

Use ``warn("some text")`` when you want to add an error message to homely's
output, but don't want to raise an exception which would bail out of the
`HOMELY.py` script completely. Note that calling ``warn()`` any time during
your `HOMELY.py` script will cause ``homely update`` and ``homely add`` to exit
with a non-zero error code when they are finished.

Example
^^^^^^^

Issue a warning when neovim is not installed::

    from homely.ui import warn
    from homely.system import haveexecutable

    if not haveexecutable('nvim'):
        warn("You haven't installed neovim or added it to your $PATH yet")


homely.ui.note()
----------------

Use ``note("some text")`` to display a message in the homely script output.

Example
^^^^^^^

Show a message before doing something::

    from homely.ui import note
    from homely.pipinstall import pipinstall


    for pkg in ('isort', 'flake8', 'ipython', 'jedi'):
        note("Running pip install of {}".format(pkg))
        pipinstall(pkg)


.. _homely-ui-allowpull:

homely.ui.allowpull()
---------------------

Returns `False` if `homely` was invoked without the `--nopull` option. You can
use this function in your `HOMELY.py` script to make that your script doesn't
attempt to download or pull changes from online when the user has explicitly
told it not to.

Example
^^^^^^^

Run `git fetch` in a private repo except when `--nopull` is used::

    import os
    from homely.system import execute
    from homely.ui import allowpull

    repopath = os.environ['HOME'] + '/src/neovim.git'
    if allowpull():
        execute(['git', 'fetch', 'origin', '--tags'], cwd=repopath)


.. _homely-ui-yesno:

homely.ui.yesno()
-----------------

Use ``yesno()`` to ask the user a yes/no question. The user will be asked to
enter "Y" or "N" before proceeding.

``yesno(name, prompt, default=None, *, recommended=None, noprompt=None)``

``name``
    If you provide a ``name``, the user's answer will be recorded and used as
    the return value on subsequent runs. If you want to prompt the user for the
    answer to a question that has been answered on a previous run, use the
    ``--alwaysprompt`` flag. If you pass ``name=None`` then the user will be
    prompted for an answer on each run. (If you are using ``name=None`` then
    you should also include a value for ``noprompt``.)
``prompt``
    Text displayed to the user. You should phrase the sentence as a question
    and end it with a question mark.
``default``
    This value will be returned if the user hits enter without choosing "Y" or
    "N", unless a ``name`` was provided, in which case ``default`` is replaced
    by the user's previous choice. If ``default=None`` and no previous answer
    is available, the user will be forced to provide an answer.
``recommended``
    This option will be suggested to the user.
``noprompt``
    If homely was invoked with the ``--neverprompt`` flag, then this value will
    be returned instead of asking the user for an answer. You can use this
    argument for ``yesno()`` calls that have ``name=None`` so that homely knows
    what to do when the user can't be asked for an answer. If ``noprompt`` is
    omitted or ``None``, and ``yesno()`` is called in a context that doesn't
    allow user input, a ``homely.ui.InputError`` will be raised.

To summarise - the return value will be:

#. If the question has a ``name`` and the user has answered this question
   previously, and the ``--alwaysprompt`` flag was not used, then the previous
   answer will be returned.

#. If there is no TTY attached or the ``--neverprompt`` flag was used:

   a. If a ``name`` was provided and the user answered this question on a
      previous run, then that answer will be returned.
   #. If ``noprompt`` has a value then that will be returned.
   #. A ``homely.ui.InputError`` will be raised

#. If the user provides a valid answer then that answer will be returned.

#. If the user hits enter without specifying "Y" or "N":

   a. If ``name`` is provided, then their previous answer will be returned.
   #. If ``default`` is not None, then it is returned.
   #. The user is forced to provide a valid answer and this answer will be returned.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

Ask the user if they would like to install ipython, and remember their choice
for next time::

    from homely.ui import yesno
    from homely.pipinstall import pipinstall
    if yesno("install_ipython", "Install ipython?", True, recommended=True)
        pipinstall("ipython")


Ask the user if they would like to perform an interactive task like edit their
.bashrc::

    from homely.ui import yesno
    from homely.system import execute
    if yesno(None, "Edit .bashrc?", True, noprompt=False):
        execute(["vim", "~/.bashrc"], stdout="TTY")


.. _homely-ui-allowinteractive:

homely.ui.allowinteractive()
----------------------------

Returns ``True`` if there is a TTY attached and the ``--neverprompt`` option
was not used.

In some circumstances no TTY is available (for example, autoupdate runs) and it
is not safe to start up an interactive program like vim from your HOMELY.py
script. You can use this function to check first.

Example
^^^^^^^

Edit the user's .bashrc if there is a TTY attached::

    from homely.ui import allowinteractive
    from homely.system import execute
    if allowinteractive():
        execute(["vim", "~/.bashrc"], stdout="TTY")
