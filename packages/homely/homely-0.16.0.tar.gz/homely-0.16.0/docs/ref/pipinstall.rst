homely.pipinstall.pipinstall()
------------------------------


Use ``pipinstall()`` to install packages from pip. The primary advantage of
using this module is that homely can automatically remove the package for you
when you no longer want it.

``pipinstall(package, pips=<see below>, *, trypips=[])``

``package``
    The name of the pip package to install
``pips``
    A list of ``pip`` executables to install the package with.
  
    ``['pip2.7', 'pip3.4']`` would install the package using both the
    ``pip2.7`` and ``pip3.4`` executables.  The default is to use ``['pip']``
    as long as you aren't using ``tripips``.
``trypips=[]``
    This is a supplementary list of ``pip`` executables that homely will use to
    install the package, but no exception will be raised if the ``pip``
    executables aren't available.

Note that the ``pip install ...`` commands are run with the ``--user`` option so
that the packages are installed into your home directory.


Examples
^^^^^^^^


Install ``isort`` using the ``pip`` executable found in your ``$PATH``::

    from homely.pipinstall import pipinstall
    pipinstall('isort')


Install ``ipython`` package for python2::

    from homely.pipinstall import pipinstall
    pipinstall('ipython', ['pip2'])

Install ``neovim`` package for python3::

    from homely.pipinstall import pipinstall
    pipinstall('neovim', ['pip3'])

Install ``ptpython`` package using whichever pip executables are present.
Don't issue a warning if some pip executables aren't found::

    from homely.pipinstall import pipinstall
    pipinstall('ipython', trypips=['pip', 'pip2', 'pip3'])
