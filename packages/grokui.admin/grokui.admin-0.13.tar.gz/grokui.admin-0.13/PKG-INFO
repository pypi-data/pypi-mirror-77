Description: grokui.admin: A basic grok admin UI
        ***********************************
        
        The replacement for the former ``grok.admin`` package.
        
        The internal name of the admin UI is:
        Grok Application Interface Application or, for short GAIA.
        
        GAIA is itself a Grok application and a subproject to the core Grok
        development. Its main goal is making developing of Zope 3 and Grok
        applications a faster and smarter job with more fun for everybody.
        
        
        Login - what is my username/password?
        =====================================
        
        Before you can use the admin UI, you first must log in.
        
        The username and password of the manager principal (kind of super
        user) can be found in the file ``buildout.cfg`` in the root of your
        subversion checkout.
        
        In case you do not know, what 'subversion checkout' means, look for a
        file ``site.zcml`` in your installation.
        
        Users of ``grokproject``, might find this file in
        ``<installdir>/parts/app/site.zcml``.
        
        
        Using the admin-UI
        ==================
        
        After login you can visit some of the main management topics, as
        described below:
        
        On top of the admin-UI you can always find three links to the main
        management activities currently possible with GAIA:
        
        
        Applications
        ------------
        
        * List of all instanciated applications
        
        * You can add new instances of Grok applications
        
        * You can rename instances of Grok applications
        
        * You can delete your installed applications.
        
        .. note:: starting with version 0.5 there is no introspector/class
           browser included in `grokui.admin` anymore. Eventually this will be
           made availabel in another package by someone else.
        
        
        Server
        ------
        
        * Set security notifications. Those are by default disabled, because
          they mean home-calling functionality you may do not want. You can
          enable/disable those notifications or set a URL to retrieve
          information about security related problems.
        
        * Start/Restart the server. Caution! This does not work, if the server
          was started in 'foreground mode' (with 'zopectl fg').
        
        * Pack the ZODB. This removes old data from the database, freeing up
          disk space. In a production environment, you might want to pack the
          ZODB automatically from `cron`. This can be done using a command
          like the following::
        
            curl -q -s -u admin:admin "http://localhost:8080/++grokui++/@@server?pack=1&days=1"
        
          which will remove old data older than one day. If you leave out the
          `days` parameter, all old data will be removed.
        
        * Get basic information about the running Zope system.
        
        * Enter a message to be displayed on top. You can, for example, leave
          a message here for your co-admins. To delete the message, just enter
          the empty string in the appropriate input box.
        
        
        
        Maintaining grok installations with the admin UI
        ================================================
        
        There are some special info views available especially for the use of
        system administrators that want to automate Grok administration in
        some aspects. They provide minimal information about certain topics.
        
        Currently the following infos are available this way:
        
        * The grok version working in background::
        
           curl -q -s -u admin:admin "http://localhost:8080/++grokui++/@@admin/@@version"
        
        * The security notification (if any)::
        
           curl -q -s -u admin:admin "http://localhost:8080/++grokui++/@@admin/@@secnote"
        
        Beside this you can pack the ZODB databases as described above.
        
        
        Bugs, Caveats and Ways to Get Help
        ==================================
        
        The Grok admin UI has been refactored during the Cologne Neanderthal Sprint
        II, in september 2009.
        
        As a matter of fact, it is still under development and
        improvement. Please, report any misbehavior or bug.

        grokui.admin changes
        ********************
        
        0.13 (2020-08-20)
        =================
        
        - Python3.6+ compatibility.
        
        0.12 (2016-02-16)
        =================
        
        - Update to follow API changes in grok.
        
        - Update tests.
        
        0.11 (2012-05-02)
        =================
        
        - Make sure to require the latest grok and grokcore.site.
        
        0.10 (2011-07-14)
        =================
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        0.9 (2011-01-20)
        ================
        
        - Use the correct IApplication interface definition.
        
        0.8 (2010-10-27)
        ================
        
        - In testing the security notifications, start a server instead of using
          file://localhost URLs. This saves a lot of urlopen troubles across
          platforms.
        
        - Test setup cleanup.
        
        0.7.2 (2010-10-26)
        ==================
        
        - Fix tests in Windows.
        
        0.7.1 (2010-10-07)
        ==================
        
        * Fix a bug in the test setup where zope.session was not configurred.
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/638763
          We don't hide away Duplication/KeyErrors that are raised during
          application creation any more.
        
        0.7.0 (2010-07-04)
        ==================
        
        * The application creation view now uses the Grok util function
          `create_application`. Therefore, the `ApplicationInitializedEvent`,
          recently introduced in Grok, is now triggered while an application is
          created and persisted. This is an important event, allowing to hook
          handlers that need local utilities and catalog indexes that are not
          yet present at the ObjectCreatedEvent stage.
        
        0.6.2 (2010-05-19)
        ==================
        
        * Modified package to comply with Zope Foundation policy.
        
        * Removed duplicated/unused code.
          Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/539940
        
        * Reflect changes in Folder API: check also for KeyError, not only for
          DuplicationError when adding new apps.
        
        * Added extra-templatedirs and moved templates into these in order to
          avoid (erraneous) templatedir-registry warnings.
        
        0.6.1 (2010-03-07)
        ==================
        
        * Added missing tests dependencies. Declarations and includes should
          now be complete.
        
        
        0.6 (2010-02-28)
        ================
        
        * Moved the ``Index`` view to ``grokui.base``.
        
        * The design has been slightly changed to get rid of the lazy Grok and
          to match the http://grok.zope.org website design. The design belongs
          now to ``grokui.base``.
        
        * ``grokui.admin`` has been splitted into several packages. It now depends
          on ``grokui.base`` that provides basic components to create and plug UI
          views. ``grokui.admin`` has been altered to reflect the splitting
          changes and now provides a collection of components that will allow
          you to plug your own administration panels and elements.
        
        * Dependencies have been drastically cut down. We are now using the
          ZTK. The only zope.app package remaining is for the tests.
        
        * Reflect the changes in grokcore.view 1.12 where View and CodeView
          become a single View again.
        
        
        0.5 (2009-09-15)
        ================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * The whole introspector stuff was removed in order to reduce number
          of dependencies.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Adding apps now emits IObjectCreated events.
        
        
        0.4.1 (2010-02-14)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Backports of fixes from 0.3.3 version (see below).
        
        
        0.4 (2009-08-21)
        ================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Added a security notifier to inform users when security issues are
          published on http://grok.zope.org. The notifier must be explicitly
          enabled. You can also run your own site/directory to place security
          notifications.
        
        * Added info views to get important information easier with tools like
          ``curl``. Supported infos:
        
            - Grok version used
        
            - Current security notification (if any).
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Adapting this package to use the new version of grokcore.view
          which splits View into CodeView.
        
        * Upgraded the versions to the alpha 4 list to avoid a dependency
          problem with zope.container versions.
        
        * Include the new grok.View permissions for testing.
        
        0.3.3 (2010-02-14)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Fixed bug in object browser: objects that 'booleanized' evaluated to
          ``False`` (empty containers for instance) were not displayed.
        
        0.3.2 (2009-04-10)
        ==================
        
        * Added dependency for zope.app.preference. This is needed by
          zope.app.apidoc but not always fetched.
        
        0.3.1 (2009-04-09)
        ==================
        
        * Fixed missing dependencies in setup.py.

        ================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Added capability to pack ZODBs (thanks to Jasper Spaans).
        
        0.2 (2008-12-01)
        ================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Added capability to rename apps.
        
        0.1.2 (2008-09-28)
        ==================
        
        * Made server controls dependent from availability of
          `IServerControl`. Otherwise the buttons for restarting or stopping
          the server process are not rendered.
        
        
        0.1.1 (2008-08-05)
        ==================
        
        * Fixed wrong links in docgrok template.
        
        * Fixed ftesting.zcml that did not work with Grok 0.13.
        
        
        0.1 (2008-07-10)
        ================
        
        Feature changes
