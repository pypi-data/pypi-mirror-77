Description: # jupyterlab_scheduler
        
        A simple plugin for scheduling files for recurring execution using the cron utility within the Jupyter Lab UI. Use cases
        
        Security Note: Cron jobs are executed under the permission set of the JupyerLab process; if you start jupyter as root (not recommended!) every job that is scheduled via the UI will also run as root.

        ## Prerequisites
        
        * JupyterLab
        * Cron installed on the JupyterLab host
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install using pip:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_scheduler
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        For a development install (requires npm version 4 or later), do the following in the repository directory:
        
        ```bash
        # Clone the repo to your local environment
        # Move to jupyterlab_scheduler directory
        # Install dependencies
        npm install
        # Install your development version of the extension
        jupyter labextension install .
        ```
        
        You run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild.
        
        ```bash
        # Run jupyterlab in watch mode
        jupyter lab --watch
        ```
        
        Now every change will be built locally and bundled into JupyterLab. Be sure to refresh your browser page after saving file changes to reload the extension (note: you'll need to wait for webpack to finish, which can take 10s+ at times).
        
        ```bash
        # Run jupyterlab in auto reload mode
        jupyter lab  --autoreload --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' --no-browser
        ```
        
        Works better when developing server extensions
        
        ## Publishing
        
        To build the plugin for disitibution on Pypi:
        
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
        ```
        
        ### Uninstall
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension uninstall jupyterlab_scheduler
        ```
