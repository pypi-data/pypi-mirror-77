    Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
    You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
    Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
    destination location.
    Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
    location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
    endpoint from route information.
    If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
    multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
    destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
    interface.
    A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
    is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
    don't intend to test.
    Structure is documented below.

      * `instance` (`str`) - A Compute Engine instance URI.
      * `ip_address` (`str`) - The IP address of the endpoint, which can be an external or
        internal IP. An IPv6 address is only allowed when the test's
        destination is a global load balancer VIP.
      * `network` (`str`) - A Compute Engine network URI.
      * `port` (`float`) - The IP protocol port of the endpoint. Only applicable when
        protocol is TCP or UDP.
      * `project_id` (`str`) - Project ID where the endpoint is located. The Project ID can be
        derived from the URI if you provide a VM instance or network URI.
        The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:
        1. Only the IP address is specified, and the IP address is within
        a GCP project. 2. When you are using Shared VPC and the IP address
        that you provide is from the service project. In this case, the
        network that the IP address resides in is defined in the host
        project.

    Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
    You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine

    source location.
    Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
    a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
    also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
    which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
    information.
    If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
    you must provide the destination VPC network.
    If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
    network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
    identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
    address or VPC network.
    A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
