Description: # Breath of the Wild Binary Animation Sequence Convert
        Converts Binary Animation Sequence (.bas) files from machine code to human-readable format and replaces TypeIndex values with names (or vice versa). For LoZ:BotW
        
        Note: Only one of the TypeIndex enums has official names. These names are listed on https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Bas. The other TypeIndex enums have been given unofficial names, also listed on that page. (NOTE: unofficial name conversion has not been implemented yet)
        
        ## Dependencies
        * A dumped copy of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (for Wii U or Switch)
        * Python 3.7+ (64-bit, added to system PATH)
        
        The following `pip` packages, which will be automatically installed:
        * oead
        
        ## Setup
        1. Download and install Python 3.7+, 64-bit. You must choose the "Add to System PATH" option during installation.
        2. Open a command line and run `pip install bas_convert`
        
        ### How to Use
        ```bas_convert [file] [output] [-n] [-d]```
        * `file` - The name of the file to convert. You can select multiple files by using wildcards. (e.g. `*.yml` will select all `.yml` files in the directory)
        * `output` - The type to output as. Accepts `yml`, `yaml`, `bas`, and `aamp`. `yml` and `yaml` are YAML, human-readable. `bas` and `aamp` are AAMP, machine-readable.
        * `-n` - Outputs the file with TypeIndex conversions to names.
        * `-d` - Outputs the file with TypeIndex conversions to digits (numbers).
        
        * All permutations of conversion have been supported, for use with tools such as `hyrule_builder` which will convert to YAML for you.

        This software is in early, but usable, beta. There are many TypeIndex types that are not yet converted, or even mapped out. Any support is appreciated.
