# Control Things Serial

The `ctui` is a library for creating terminal-based user interfaces, and is used in all the ControlThings tools at controlthings.io.  It is similar to using Click or Python's standard Cmd library, but with a curses-like interface written in pure Python.

# Installation:

As long as you have git and Python 3.6 or later installed, all you should need to do is:

```
pip3 install ctui
```

# Usage:

Import the library, instantiate a Ctui object, and start the ctui application, like:

```
from ctui import Ctui

myapp = Ctui()
myapp.run()
```

Of course you can configure you app in a number of different ways by modifying your app's attributes or by adding your own custom commands.   Check out the `examples` folder to walk you through some of these.  For more complex examples how to use ctui, check out the various ControlThings Tools, most of which use ctui.  You can find these at https://github.com/ControlThingsTools.

# Platform Independence

Python 3.5+ and all dependencies are available for all major operating systems.  It is primarily developed on MacOS and Linux, but should work in Windows as well.
