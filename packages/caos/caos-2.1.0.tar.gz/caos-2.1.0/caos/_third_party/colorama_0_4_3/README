This library has been added to the project from the https://github.com/tartley/colorama git repository

The original source code requires this to be installed by using the setup.py but the library provided here
has been extracted from the python site-packages after installation so that it can be used by anyone without
requiring installing extra libraries from the PyPi repository.
