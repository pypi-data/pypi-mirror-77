Description: # Local Emulator for Google Cloud Storage
        
        Google doesn't (yet) ship an emulator for the Cloud Storage API like they do for
        Cloud Datastore.
        
        This is a stub emulator so you can run your tests and do local development without
        having to connect to the production Storage APIs.
        
        **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND ONLY SUPPORTS A LIMITED SUBSET OF THE API**

        ## Installation
        
        `pip install gcloud-storage-emulator`
        
        
        
        ## CLI Usage
        
        
        ### Starting the emulator
        Start the emulator with:
        
        ```bash
        $ gcloud-storage-emulator start --port=9090
        ```
        
        By default, data is stored under `$PWD/.cloudstorage`. You can configure the folder using the env variables `STORAGE_BASE` and `STORAGE_DIR`.
        
        If you wish to run the emulator in a testing environment or if you don't want to persist any data, you can use the `--no-store-on-disk` parameter. For tests, you might want to consider starting up the server from your code (see the [Python APIs](#python-apis))
        
        If you're using the Google client library (e.g. `google-cloud-storage` for Python) then you can set the `STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable to tell the library to connect to your emulator endpoint rather than the standard `https://storage.googleapis.com`, e.g.:
        
        ```bash
        $ export STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=http://localhost:9090
        ```
        
        
        ### Wiping data
        
        You can wipe the data by running
        
        ```bash
        $ gcloud-storage-emulator wipe
        ```
        
        ## Python APIs
        
        To start a server from your code you can do
        
        ```python
        from gcloud_storage_emulator.server import create_server
        
        server = create_server("localhost", 9023, in_memory=False)
        
        server.start()
        # ........
        server.stop()
        ```
        
        You can wipe the data (e.g. for text execution) by calling `server.wipe()`
        
        This can also be achieved (e.g. during tests) by hitting the `/wipe` endpoint
