For example: I have pavan.jpg photo under /home/pavan/Desktop/pavan.jpg so my input file path is
						
				/home/pavan/Desktop/pavan.jpg 

I want the new transfromed photo at the same folder (Desktop) as new.jpg Here my outputfile path looks like

After the program executes the transformed photo is saved under the path you have provided.
