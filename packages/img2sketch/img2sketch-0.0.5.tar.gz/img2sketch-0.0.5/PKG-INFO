Description: ##img2sketch
        
        This is a simple Python package that converts your beautiful photos to pencil art. The transformed photo just looks like a photo which is drawn using pencil.
        
        For this package to run without any errors the following packages should be installed on your system 	
        		opencv-python
        		numpy
        
        All you have to do is just download the package as
        
        	pip install img2sketch
        You can type in your terminal as
        
        ##usage
        
        		img2sketch -i <innputfile path> -o <outputfile path>
        	
        
        
        For example: I have pavan.jpg photo under /home/pavan/Desktop/pavan.jpg so my input file path is
        						
        				/home/pavan/Desktop/pavan.jpg 
        
        I want the new transfromed photo at the same folder (Desktop) as new.jpg Here my outputfile path looks like
        
              		  /home/pavan/Desktop/new.jpg
        
        After the program executes the transformed photo is saved under the path you have provided.
