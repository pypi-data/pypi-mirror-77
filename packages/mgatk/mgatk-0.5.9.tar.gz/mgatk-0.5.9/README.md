## About
This repository houses the **mgatk** package, a python-based command line interface for
processing `.bam` files with mitochondrial reads and generating high-quality heteroplasmy 
estimation from sequencing data. This package places a special emphasis on mitochondrial
genotypes generated from single-cell genomics data, primarily `mtscATAC-seq`, but is generally
applicable across other assays. 
<br>

Check out the [**mgatk** documentation](https://github.com/caleblareau/mgatk/wiki) for more 
information and user guides. 

## Contact

The **mgatk** package was developed and is maintained by [Caleb Lareau](https://profiles.stanford.edu/caleb-lareau).
