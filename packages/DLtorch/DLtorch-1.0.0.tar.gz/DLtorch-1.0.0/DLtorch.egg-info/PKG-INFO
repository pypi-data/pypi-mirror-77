Description: ## DLtorch: An Extensible Deep Learning Framework based on Pytorch
        
        ## Introduction
        With the rapid development of deep learning technology in the field of artificial intelligence, 
        a series of deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Jittor, Pytorch, have been born. 
        Among which, pytorch as a rising star, has the advantages of python-like syntax and ease of network construction.
        However, using the native pytorch framework to train a deep neural network (DNN) still requires a lot of codes and work. 
        For this reason, we developed DLtorch, an extensible deep learning framework based on pytorch, to quickly implement DNN algorithms.
        
        ### Components of a DNN training system
        Generally, a typical DNN training system, can be categorized into components below. 
        And in DLtorch framework, the interface between these components is somehow well-defined.
        ```
        Components:
          -- dataset             The dataset to train and test on.
          -- criterion           Crierion used for training.
          -- model               Neural network.
          -- optimizer           Define how to optimize the parameters of a network.
          -- lr_scheduler        Define how to adjust the learning rate while training.
          -- objective           Define the loss, accuracy, reward and other statistics while training.
          -- trainer             Define how to train a model.
        ```
        Flow of DLtorch is shown below.

        ## Install
        Using a virtual python environment is encouraged. For example, with Anaconda, you could run `conda create -n DLtorch python==3.7.3 pip` first.
        * Supported python versions: 3.6, 3.7
        * Supported Pytorch versions: >=1.0.0, <1.5.0
        To install `DLtorch`, run `pip install DLtorch` directly or `python setup.py build && python setup.py install` after cloning this project.
        
        ## Usage
        After installation, you can run `DLtorch --help` to see what sub-commands are available.

        ```
        DLtorch train examples/cifar10_basic.yaml --gpus 0 --seed 123 --save-every <SAVE_EVERY> --train-dir <TRAIN_DIR>

        ```
        Try testing a pretrained resnet-18 net on cifar10, the results (including configuration backup, testing log) will be saved in `<TEST_DIR>`). Nothing will be saved if `<TEST_DIR>` isn't given.
        
        ```
        DLtorch test examples/cifar10_basic.yaml --gpus 0 --load <CHECKPOINT_DIR> --dataset test --device cuda --testdir <TEST_DIR>
        ```
        
        ### Show DLtorch Registered Components
        Only components registered by DLtorch framework can be used while training and testing. Components registered in our framework include those supported by Pytorch and those implemented by us. 
        Run `DLtorch components` to see what components are implemented.
        ```
        Usage: DLtorch components [OPTIONS]
        
          Show All The Registered Components
        
        Options:
          --register_file TEXT  Register_file
          --help                Show this message and exit.
        ```
        
        ### Components Registeration
        DLtorch framework itself only support components implemented in our framework and Pytorch. To use new designed components, they have to be registered into DLtorch before using.
        In command line, we provide a registeration interface `--register_file`. To use new components, it must be defined in a python file. And a function named `register`, in which components are rigistered into DLtorch, must be provided in it.
        We provide APIs for registering different components as below. Details can be seen in our code.
        
        ```
        DLtorch.components.regist_Criterion  # Regist a criterion
        DLtorch.components.regist_scheduler  # Regist a learning rate scheduler
        DLtorch.components.regist_model      # Regist a model
        DLtorch.components.regist_objective  # Regist an objective (subclass "BaseObjective")
        DLtorch.components.regist_optimizer  # Regist an optimizer
        DLtorch.components.regist_trainer    # Regist a trainer (subclass "BaseFinalTrainer")
        ```
        
        For examples, try training a ResNet-18 net on cifar10 from scratch using a new designed component `ExampleNewObjective` defined and registed in `examples/example_new_objective.py`.
        
        ```
        DLtorch train examples/register_example.yaml --gpus 0 --seed 123 --save-every <SAVE_EVERY> --train-dir <TRAIN_DIR> --register_file examples/example_new_objective.py 
        ```
        
        ### Adversarial Attack & Adversarial Training
        We implement adversarial attack and adversarial training in our framework. It's split into two parts: adversarial example generator and adversarial objective. Currently, we only support FGSM and PGD attack. You can implement your own by subclassing `BaseAdvGenerator` and `ClassificationAdversarialObjective`. Welcome to fork us and share your implementation.
        
        Try adversarially training a resnet-18 net on cifar10 with PGD method.
        
        ```
        DLtorch test examples/cifar10_adv.yaml --gpus 0 --seed 123 --save-every <SAVE_EVERY> --train-dir <TRAIN_DIR>
        ```
        
        ### Notation
