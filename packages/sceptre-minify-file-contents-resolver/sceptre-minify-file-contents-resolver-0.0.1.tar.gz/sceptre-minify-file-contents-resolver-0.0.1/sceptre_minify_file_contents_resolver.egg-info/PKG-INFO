Description: # Minify File Contents Resolver
        
        Reads in the contents of a file and minifies them if applicable.
        
        Syntax:
        
        ```yaml
        parameters|sceptre_user_data:
          <name>: !minify_file_contents /path/to/file.txt
        ```
        
        Example:
        
        ```yaml
        sceptre_user_data:
          inline_lambda_code: !minify_file_contents /path/to/policy.js
        ```
        
        Add your resolver readme here. Remember to include the following:
        
        - Tell people how to install it (e.g. pip install ...).
        - Be clear about the purpose of the resolver, its capabilities and limitations.
        - Tell people how to use it.
        - Give examples of the resolver in use.

        # Testing
        
        We have included a basic testing set up for you. You will need to unit test your code so remember to update `tests/...`.
        
        # Releasing
        
        1. Update the CHANGELOG.md with what has changed (see the example in the CHANGELOG comments).
        2. In your virtualenv run `bumpversion --dry-run --verbose patch|minor|major`. You will see that the version number will be updated, a commit is made for the version update and a new git tag will be created.
        3. If you are happy with the dry run then execute `bumpversion patch|minor|major`.
        4. Push the commit with `git push`.
        5. When the build for the above step is complete push the tag `git push origin vX.Y.Z` this will trigger a release build which will deploy to PyPi.
