    Assigns microarray expression data to ROIs defined in `atlas`

    This function aims to provide a workflow for generating pre-processed,
    microarray expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas ([A2]_) for
    abitrary `atlas` designations. First, some basic filtering of genetic
    probes is performed, including:

        1. Intensity-based filtering of microarray probes to remove probes that
           do not exceed a certain level of background noise (specified via the
           `ibf_threshold` parameter), and
        2. Selection of a single, representative probe (or collapsing across
           probes) for each gene, specified via the `probe_selection`
           parameter.

    Tissue samples are then matched to parcels in the defined `atlas` for each
    donor. If `atlas_info` is provided then this matching is constrained by
    both hemisphere and tissue class designation (e.g., cortical samples from
    the left hemisphere are only matched to ROIs in the left cortex,
    subcortical samples from the right hemisphere are only matched to ROIs in
    the left subcortex); see the `atlas_info` parameter description for more
    information.

    Matching of microarray samples to parcels in `atlas` is done via a multi-
    step process:

        1. Determine if the sample falls directly within a parcel,
        2. Check to see if there are nearby parcels by slowly expanding the
           search space to include nearby voxels, up to a specified distance
           (specified via the `tolerance` parameter),
        3. If there are multiple nearby parcels, the sample is assigned to the
           closest parcel, as determined by the parcel centroid.

    If at any step a sample can be assigned to a parcel the matching process is
    terminated. If multiple sample are assigned to the same parcel they are
    aggregated with the metric specified via the `metric` parameter. More
    control over the sample matching can be obtained by setting the `exact`
    parameter; see the parameter description for more information.

    Once all samples have been matched to parcels for all supplied donors, the
    microarray expression data are optionally normalized via the provided
    `sample_norm` and `gene_norm` functions before being combined within
    parcels and across donors via the supplied `agg_metric`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atlas : niimg-like object
        A parcellation image in MNI space, where each parcel is identified by a
        unique integer ID
    atlas_info : str or pandas.DataFrame, optional
        Filepath to or pre-loaded dataframe containing information about
        `atlas`. Must have at least columns 'id', 'hemisphere', and 'structure'
        containing information mapping atlas IDs to hemisphere (i.e, "L", "R")
        and broad structural class (i.e., "cortex", "subcortex", "cerebellum").
        If provided, this will constrain matching of tissue samples to regions
        in `atlas`. Default: None
    ibf_threshold : [0, 1] float, optional
        Threshold for intensity-based filtering. This number specifies the
        ratio of samples, across all supplied donors, for which a probe must
        have signal significantly greater background noise in order to be
        retained. Default: 0.5
    probe_selection : str, optional
        Selection method for subsetting (or collapsing across) probes that
        index the same gene. Must be one of 'average', 'max_intensity',
        'max_variance', 'pc_loading', 'corr_variance', 'corr_intensity', or
        'diff_stability', 'rnaseq'; see Notes for more information on different
        options. Default: 'diff_stability'
    donor_probes : str, optional
        Whether specified `probe_selection` method should be performed with
        microarray data from all donors ('aggregate'), independently for each
        donor ('independent'), or based on the most common selected probe
        across donors ('common'). Not all combinations of `probe_selection`
        and `donor_probes` methods are viable. Default: 'aggregate'
    lr_mirror : bool, optional
        Whether to mirror microarray expression samples across hemispheres to
        increase spatial coverage. This will duplicate samples across both
        hemispheres (i.e., L->R and R->L), approximately doubling the number of
        available samples. Default: False
    exact : bool, optional
        Whether to use exact matching of donor tissue samples to parcels in
        `atlas`. If True, this function will ONLY match tissue samples to
        parcels within `threshold` mm of the sample; any samples that are
        beyond `threshold` mm of a parcel will be discarded. This may result
        in some parcels having no assigned sample / expression data. If False,
        the default matching procedure will be performed and followed by a
        check for parcels with no assigned samples; any such parcels will be
        matched to the nearest sample (defined as the sample with the closest
        Euclidean distance to the parcel centroid). Default: True
    tolerance : int, optional
        Distance (in mm) that a sample must be from a parcel for it to be
        matched to that parcel. This is only considered if the sample is not
        directly within a parcel. Default: 2
    sample_norm : {'rs', 'srs', 'minmax', 'center', 'zscore', None}, optional
        Method by which to normalize microarray expression values for each
        sample. Expression values are normalized separately for each sample and
        donor across all genes; see Notes for more information on different
        methods. If None is specified then no normalization is performed.
        Default: 'srs'
    gene_norm : {'rs', 'srs', 'minmax', 'center', 'zscore', None}, optional
        Method by which to normalize microarray expression values for each
        donor. Expression values are normalized separately for each gene and
        donor across all samples; see Notes for more information on different
        methods. If None is specified then no normalization is performed.
        Default: 'srs'
    region_agg : {'samples', 'donors'}, optional
        When multiple samples are identified as belonging to a region in
        `atlas` this determines how they are aggegated. If 'samples',
        expression data from all samples for all donors assigned to a given
        region are combined. If 'donors', expression values for all samples
        assigned to a given region are combined independently for each donor
        before being combined across donors. See `agg_metric` for mechanism by
        which samples are combined. Default: 'donors'
    agg_metric : {'mean', 'median'} or callable, optional
        Mechanism by which to reduce sample-level expression data into region-
        level expression (see `region_agg`). If a callable, should be able to
        accept an `N`-dimensional input and the `axis` keyword argument and
        return an `N-1`-dimensional output. Default: 'mean'
    corrected_mni : bool, optional
        Whether to use the "corrected" MNI coordinates shipped with the
        `alleninf` package instead of the coordinates provided with the AHBA
        data when matching tissue samples to anatomical regions. Default: True
    reannotated : bool, optional
        Whether to use reannotated probe information provided by [A1]_ instead
        of the default probe information from the AHBA dataset. Using
        reannotated information will discard probes that could not be reliably
        matched to genes. Default: True
    return_counts : bool, optional
        Whether to return dataframe containing information on how many samples
        were assigned to each parcel in `atlas` for each donor. Default: False
    return_donors : bool, optional
        Whether to return donor-level expression arrays instead of aggregating
        expression across donors with provided `agg_metric`. Default: False
    donors : list, optional
        List of donors to use as sources of expression data. Can be either
        donor numbers or UID. If not specified will use all available donors.
        Note that donors '9861' and '10021' have samples from both left + right
        hemispheres; all other donors have samples from the left hemisphere
        only. Default: 'all'
    data_dir : str, optional
        Directory where expression data should be downloaded (if it does not
        already exist) / loaded. If not specified will use the current
        directory. Default: None
    verbose : int, optional
        Specifies verbosity of status messages to display during workflow.
        Higher numbers increase verbosity of messages while zero suppresses all
        messages. Default: 1
    n_proc : int, optional
        Number of processors to use to download AHBA data. Can parallelize up
        to six times. Default: 1

    Returns
    -------
    expression : (R, G) pandas.DataFrame
        Microarray expression for `R` regions in `atlas` for `G` genes,
        aggregated across donors, where the index corresponds to the unique
        integer IDs of `atlas` and the columns are gene names. If
        ``return_donors=True`` then this is a list of (R, G) dataframes, one
        for each donor.
    counts : (R, D) pandas.DataFrame
        Number of samples assigned to each of `R` regions in `atlas` for each
        of `D` donors (if multiple donors were specified); only returned if
        ``return_counts=True``.

    Notes
    -----
    The following methods can be used for collapsing across probes when
    multiple probes are available for the same gene:

        1. ``probe_selection='average'``

        Takes the average of expression data across all probes indexing the
        same gene. Providing 'mean' as the input method will return the same
        thing. This method can only be used when `donor_probes='aggregate'`.

        2. ``probe_selection='max_intensity'``

        Selects the probe with the maximum average expression across samples
        from all donors.

        3. ``probe_selection='max_variance'``

        Selects the probe with the maximum variance in expression across
        samples from all donors.

        4. ``probe_selection='pc_loading'``

        Selects the probe with the maximum loading along the first principal
        component of a decomposition performed across samples from all donors.

        5. ``probe_selection='corr_intensity'``

        Selects the probe with the maximum correlation to other probes from the
        same gene when >2 probes exist; otherwise, uses the same procedure as
        `max_intensity`.

        6. ``probe_selection='corr_variance'``

        Selects the probe with the maximum correlation to other probes from the
        same gene when >2 probes exist; otherwise, uses the same procedure as
        `max_varance`.

        7. ``probe_selection='diff_stability'``

        Selects the probe with the most consistent pattern of regional
        variation across donors (i.e., the highest average correlation across
        brain regions between all pairs of donors). This method can only be
        used when `donor_probes='aggregate'`.

        8. ``method='rnaseq'``

        Selects probes with most consistent pattern of regional variation to
        RNAseq data (across the two donors with RNAseq data). This method can
        only be used when `donor_probes='aggregate'`.

    Note that for incompatible combinations of `probe_selection` and
    `donor_probes` (as detailed above), the `probe_selection choice will take
    precedence. For example, providing ``probe_selection='diff_stability'`` and
    ``donor_probes='independent'`` will cause `donor_probes` to be reset to
    `'aggregate'`.

    The following methods can be used for normalizing microarray expression
    values prior to aggregating:

        1. ``{sample,gene}_norm=='rs'``

        Uses a robust sigmoid function as in [A3]_ to normalize values

        2. ``{sample,gene}_norm='srs'``

        Same as 'rs' but scales output to the unit normal (i.e., range 0-1)

        3. ``{sample,gene}_norm='minmax'``

        Scales data to the unit normal (i.e., range 0-1)

        4. ``{sample,gene}_norm='center'``

        Removes the mean of expression values

        5. ``{sample,gene}_norm='zscore'``

        Applies a basic z-score (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation);
        uses degrees of freedom equal to one for standard deviation
