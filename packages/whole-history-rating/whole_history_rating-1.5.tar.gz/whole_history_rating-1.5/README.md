# whole_history_rating
a python convertion from the ruby implementation of Rémi Coulom's Whole-History Rating (WHR) algorithm.

the original code can be found [here](https://github.com/goshrine/whole_history_rating)


Installation
------------

    pip install whole_history_rating

Usage
-----

    from whr import whole_history_rating
    
    whr = whole_history_rating.Base()
    
    # Base.create_game() arguments: black player name, white player name, winner, day number, handicap
    # Handicap should generally be less than 500 elo
    whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "B", 1, 0)
    whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "W", 2, 0)
    whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "W", 3, 0)

    # Iterate the WHR algorithm towards convergence with more players/games, more iterations are needed.
    whr.iterate(50)
    
    # Or let the module iterate until the elo is stable (precision by default 10E-3) with a time limit of 10 seconds by default
    whr.auto_iterate(time_limit = 10, precision = 10E-3)

    # Results are stored in one triplet for each game: [day_number, elo_rating, uncertainty]
    whr.ratings_for_player("shusaku") => 
      [[1, -43, 84], 
       [2, -45, 84], 
       [3, -45, 84]]
    whr.ratings_for_player("shusai") => 
      [[1, 43, 84], 
       [2, 45, 84], 
       [3, 45, 84]]

    # You can print or get all ratings ordered
    whr.print_ordered_ratings(current=False) # current to True to only get the last rank estimation
    whr.get_ordered_ratings(current=False, compact=False) # compact to True to not have the name before each ranks

    # You can get a prediction for a future game between two players (even non existing players)
    # Base.probability_future_match() arguments: black player name, white player name, handicap
    whr.probability_future_match("shusaku", "shusai",0) =>
      win probability: shusaku:37.24%; shusai:62.76%
      
    # You can load several games all together using a file or a list of string representing the game
    # all elements in list must be like: "black_name white_name winner time_step handicap extras" 
    # you can exclude handicap (default=0) and extras (default={})
    whr.load_games(["shusaku shusai B 1 0", "shusaku shusai W 2", "shusaku shusai W 3 0"])
    whr.load_games(["firstname1 name1, firstname2 name2, W, 1"], separator=",")

    # You can save and load a base (you don't have to redo all iterations)
    whr.save_base(path)
    whr2 = whole_history_rating.Base.load_base(path)
    
    
Optional Configuration
----------------------

One of the meta parameters to WHR is the variance of rating change over one time step, :w2,
which determines how much that a player's rating is likely change in one day.  Higher numbers allow for faster progress.
The default value is 300, which is fairly high.  
Rémi Coulom in his paper, used w2=14 to get his [results](https://www.remi-coulom.fr/WHR/WHR.pdf)


    whr = whole_history_rating.Base({'w2':14})

You can also set the base not case sensitive. "shusaku" and "ShUsAkU" will be the same.

    whr = whole_history_rating.Base({'uncased':True})
