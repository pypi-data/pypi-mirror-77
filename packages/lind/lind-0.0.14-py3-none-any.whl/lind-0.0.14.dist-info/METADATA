Description: # Lind
        
        A short description.
        
        ### Authors
        
        **James Montgomery** - *Initial Work* - [jamesmontgomery.us](http://jamesmontgomery.us)
        
        ### License
        
        This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
        
        ### Installing
        
        For a local installation, first git clone this repository. Then follow these instructions:
        
        ```
        pip install .
        ```
        
        To install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/):
        
        ```
        pip install -U lind
        ```
        
        To install the package with test dependencies add `["tests"]` to the install command:
        
        ```
        pip install .["tests"]
        # or
        pip install -U lind["tests"]
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        
        Testing is an important part of creating maintainable, production grade code. Below are instructions for running unit and style tests as well as installing the necessary testing packages. Tests have intentionally been separated from the installable pypi package for a variety of reasons.
        
        Make sure you have the required testing packages:
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements_test.txt
        ```
        
        To install the project  with test dependencies see the install section.
        
        ### Running the unit tests
        
        We use the pytest framework for unit testing.
        
        ```
        pytest -vvl -s --cov lind --disable-pytest-warnings
        ```
        
        ### Running the style tests
        
        Having neat and legible code is important. Having documentation is also important. We use pylint as our style guide framework. Many of our naming conventions follow directly from the literary sources they come from. This makes it easier to read the mathematical equations and see how they translate into the code. This sometimes forces us to break pep8 conventions for naming.
        
        ```
        pylint lind --disable=invalid-name
        ```
        
        ## Contributor's Guide
        
        Here are some basic guidelines for contributing.
        
        ### Branch Strategy
        
        This repository doesn't use a complicated branching strategy. Simply create a feature branch off of master. When the feature is ready to be integrated with master, submit a pull request. A pull request will re quire at least one peer review and approval from the repository owner.
        
        ### Style Guide
        
        Please stick to pep8 standards when for your code. Use numpy style docstrings.
        
        ### Test Requirements
        
        Please use pytest as your testing suite. You code should have >= 80% coverage.
        
        ### Updating the Docs
        
        Updating the documentation is simple. First, let auto-docs check for updates to the package structure.
        
        ```
        cd docs
        make html
        ```
