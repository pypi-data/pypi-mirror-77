Description: 
                SAGE (Shapley Additive Global importancE) is a game theoretic approach 
                for understanding black-box machine learning models. It summarizes each 
                feature's importance based on the predictive power it contributes, and 
                it accounts for complex interactions by using the Shapley value from 
                cooperative game theory. See the 
                [GitHub page](https://github.com/iancovert/sage/) for examples, and see 
                the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00668) for more details.
