# Cellocity

Cellocity is a python package that allows the user to perform optical flow and PIV analysis on microscopy data. It is intended to be helpful in both the exploratory and in the data acquisition phases of a cell dynamics project. In the exploratory phase several different algorithms, settings, and preprocessing steps can be evaluated. In the data acquisition phase a pre-determined pipeline can be "hard coded" in to a GUI-based application that does not require expertise to utilize. 

## Velocity and vector analysis of microscopy data

Cellocity can create vector field visualizations, speed graphs, and multiple advanced vector field analysis.
