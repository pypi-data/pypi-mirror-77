Description: PythonQwt: Qt plotting widgets for Python
        =========================================

        The ``PythonQwt`` package is a 2D-data plotting library using Qt graphical 
        user interfaces for the Python programming language. It is compatible with 
        both ``PyQt4`` and ``PyQt5`` (``PySide`` is currently not supported but it
        could be in the near future as it would "only" requires testing to support 
        it as a stable alternative to PyQt).
        
        The ``PythonQwt`` project was initiated to solve -at least temporarily- the 
        obsolescence issue of `PyQwt` (the Python-Qwt C++ bindings library) which is 
        no longer maintained. The idea was to translate the original Qwt C++ code to 
        Python and then to optimize some parts of the code by writing new modules 
        based on NumPy and other libraries.
        
        The ``PythonQwt`` package consists of a single Python package named `qwt` 
        which is a pure Python implementation of Qwt C++ library with some 
        limitations: efforts were concentrated on basic plotting features, leaving 
        higher level features to the `guiqwt` library.
        
        See `README`_ and documentation (`online`_ or `PDF`_) for more details on the library and `changelog`_ for recent history of changes.
