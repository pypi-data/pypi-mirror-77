The `PythonQwt` project was initiated to solve -at least temporarily- the 
obsolescence issue of `PyQwt` (the Python-Qwt C++ bindings library) which is 
no longer maintained. The idea was to translate the original Qwt C++ code to 
Python and then to optimize some parts of the code by writing new modules 
based on NumPy and other libraries.

The `PythonQwt` package consists of a single Python package named `qwt` and 
of a few other files (examples, doc, ...).

See documentation [online](https://pythonqwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [PDF](https://pythonqwt.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/) for more details on 
the library and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent history of changes.

## Sample

```python
import qwt
import numpy as np

app = qwt.qt.QtGui.QApplication([])

# Create plot widget
plot = qwt.QwtPlot("Trigonometric functions")
plot.insertLegend(qwt.QwtLegend(), qwt.QwtPlot.BottomLegend)

# Create two curves and attach them to plot
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 500)
qwt.QwtPlotCurve.make(x, np.cos(x), "Cosinus", plot, linecolor="red", antialiased=True)
qwt.QwtPlotCurve.make(x, np.sin(x), "Sinus", plot, linecolor="blue", antialiased=True)

# Resize and show plot
plot.resize(600, 300)
plot.show()

app.exec_()
```

## Examples (tests)

The GUI-based test launcher may be executed from Python:

```python
from qwt import tests
tests.run()
```

or from the command line:

```bash
PythonQwt-tests
```

## Overview

The `qwt` package is a pure Python implementation of `Qwt` C++ library with 
the following limitations.

The following `Qwt` classes won't be reimplemented in `qwt` because more
powerful features already exist in `guiqwt`: `QwtPlotZoomer`, 
`QwtCounter`, `QwtEventPattern`, `QwtPicker`, `QwtPlotPicker`.

Only the following plot items are currently implemented in `qwt` (the only 
plot items needed by `guiqwt`): `QwtPlotItem` (base class), `QwtPlotItem`, 
`QwtPlotMarker`, `QwtPlotSeriesItem` and `QwtPlotCurve`.

See "Overview" section in [documentation](https://pythonqwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
for more details on API limitations when comparing to Qwt.
