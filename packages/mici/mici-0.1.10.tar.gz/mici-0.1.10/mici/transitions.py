    Rather than independently sampling a new momentum, instead a pertubative
    Crank-Nicolson type update which produces a new momentum value with a
    specified correlation with the previous value is used. It is assumed that
    the conditional distribution of the momenta is zero-mean Gaussian such that
    the Crank-Nicolson update leaves the momenta conditional distribution
    exactly invariant. This approach is sometimes known as partial momentum
    refreshing or updating, and was originally proposed in [1].

    If the resampling coefficient is equal to zero then the momentum is not
    randomized at all and succesive applications of the coupled integration
    transitions will continue along the same simulated Hamiltonian trajectory.
    When an integration transition is accepted this means the subsequent
    simulated trajectory will continue evolving in the same direction and so
    not randomising the momentum will reduce random-walk behaviour. However on
    a rejection the integration direction is reversed and so without
    randomisation the trajectory will exactly backtrack along the previous
    tractory states. A resampling coefficient of one corresponds to the
    standard case of independent resampling of the momenta while intermediate
    values between zero and one correspond to varying levels of correlation
    between the pre and post update momentums.
