        ## Overview
        
        Investors use news articles to gain an idea of market sentiment and hopefully
        be able to predict the direction of markets based on the sentiment of these
        articles and how they are published. The `finnews` library is designed to help
        the collection of news articles related to business topics and market news easy
        and efficient.
        
        ## Setup
        
        Right now, the library is not hosted on **PyPi** so you will need to do a local
        install on your system if you plan to use it in other scrips you use.
        
        First, clone this repo to your local system. After you clone the repo, make sure
        to run the `setup.py` file, so you can install any dependencies you may need. To
        run the `setup.py` file, run the following command in your terminal.
        
        ```console
        pip install fin-news
        ```
        
        This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once done
        you can use the library wherever you want.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here is a simple example of using the `finnews` library to to grab the top stories
        on CNBC.
        
        ```python
        from pprint import pprint
        from finnews.client import News
        
        # Create a new instance of the News Client.
        news_client = News()
        
        # Grab the CNBC News Client.
        cnbc_news_client = news_client.cnbc
        
        # Grab the top news.
        cbnc_top_news = cnbc_news_client.news_feed(topic='top_news')
        
        # Print it.
        pprint(cbnc_top_news)
        ```
