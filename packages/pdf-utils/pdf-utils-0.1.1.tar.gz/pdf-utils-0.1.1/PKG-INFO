Description: ## Tools for processing pdf files
        
        This is a light-weighted library for processing pdf files in python.
        One of the use-cases might be the extraction of pdf-annotations for ML / NLP.
        
        Support for
        
        * obtaining textual and vizual content of pdf files
        * locating positions of words
        * fetching pdf annotations
        * adding a digital layer to image-pdfs
        * re-creating a clean pdf file with annotations removed
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        Main tools for reading pdf files are the PyPDF2 library. Non-python dependencies are
         
        * [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/),
        * [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html), and 
        * [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).
        
        To install Poppler, see the guide in the [pdf2image readme](https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/).
        
        ## How to
        
        Some examples of usage are shown in the [notebook](./notebook/Demo.ipynb).
        
        ## Todo
        
        * Add detection of page-orientation (upside-down, rotated,...) based on images.
        * Add some of our experiments with "naive" table detection
        * Get rid of PyPDF2 as [it is not maintained](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63199763/maintained-alternatives-to-pypdf2); replace by PyMUPdf or pdfMiner.six.
