texstrip
========

``texstrip`` is a small tool that strips (removes) comments from TeX sources. I made this tool to relieve myself from manually deleting comments when submitting TeX sources to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/help/faq/whytex).

It removes both inline comments (i.e., things between ``%`` and the next ``\n``) and comment environments (i.e., things within ``\begin{comment}`` and ``\end{comment}``),
copies the supplementary files to a new folder for a clean submission.

LaTeX is a complex beast and this tool, despite its humble goal, might fail on corner cases. I fixed many of them during my own use but YMMV. If you do encounter glitches, please submit a PR and let's make it better together!
