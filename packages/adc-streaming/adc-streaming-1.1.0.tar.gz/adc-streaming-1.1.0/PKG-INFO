Description: # Astronomy Data Commons Streaming Client Libraries
        
        Libraries making it easy to access astronomy data commons resources.
        
        ## Developer notes
        
        ### Setup
        
        To prepare for development, run `pip install --editable ".[dev]"` from within
        the repo directory. This will install all dependencies, including those using
        during development workflows.
        
        This project expects you to use a `pip`-centric workflow for development on the
        project itself. If you're using conda, then use the conda environment's `pip` to
        install development dependencies, as described above.
        
        Integration tests require Docker to run a Kafka broker. The broker might have
        network problems on OSX if you use Docker Desktop; run the tests in a Linux
        virtual machine (like with VirtualBox) to get around this.
        
        ### Code Workflow
        
        Write code, making changes.
        
        Use `make format` to reformat your code to comply with PEP8.
        
        Use `make lint` to catch common mistakes.
        
        Use `make test-quick` to run fast unit tests.
        
        Use `make test` to run the full slow test suite, including integration tests.
        
        Once satisfied with all four of those, push your changes and open a PR.
        
        ### Tag, build, and upload to PyPI and Conda
        
        Tag a new version:
        ```
        git tag -s -a v0.x.x
        ```
        
        Build and release:
        
        ```
        make pypi-dist
        make pypi-dist-check
        make pypi-upload
        make conda-build
        make conda-upload
        ```
