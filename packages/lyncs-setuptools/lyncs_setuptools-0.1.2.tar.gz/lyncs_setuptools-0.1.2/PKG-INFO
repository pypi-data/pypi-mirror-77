Description: # Setup tools for Lyncs
        
        In this package we provide various setup tools used by Lyncs.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed via `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install --user lyncs_setuptools
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Lyncs' setuptools try to find most of the common setup parameters and defines its own `setup` function as in setuptools.
        
        One can use in a `setup.py` file the following script
        
        ```
        from lyncs_setuptools import setup
        
        setup(package_name, **kwargs)
        ```
        
        where package_name is the name of the package and kwargs are a list of arguments replacing or adding to the one automatically deduced by lyncs_setuptools.
        
        For seeing the list of the automatically deduced options, run `lyncs_setuptools` from command line from the directory containing the setup.py.
        
        ## CMakeExension
        
        Based on https://www.benjack.io/2017/06/12/python-cpp-tests.html we provide a CMakeExtension to support CMake files.
        
        One can add a CMakeExtension by doing
        
        ```
        from lyncs_setuptools import setup, CMakeExtension
        
        ext = CMakeExtension(install_dir, source_dir='.', cmake_args=[])
        
        setup(package_name, ext_modules = [ext])
        ```
