# How to contribute to fastprogress

First, thanks a lot for wanting to help!

## Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastprogress/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fastai/fastprogress/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* Be sure to add the complete error messages.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/fastai/fastprogress).
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

* Please ask it on the [fast.ai forum](http://forums.fast.ai/) (after searching someone didn't ask the same one before with a quick search).
