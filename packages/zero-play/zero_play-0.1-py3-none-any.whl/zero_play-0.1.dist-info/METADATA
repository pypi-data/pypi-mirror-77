# Zero Play [![Build Status Badge]][latest build] [![Code Coverage]][codecov] #
## Teach a computer to play any game. ##

[Build Status Badge]: https://travis-ci.org/donkirkby/zero-play.svg?branch=master
[latest build]: https://travis-ci.org/donkirkby/zero-play
[Code Coverage]: https://codecov.io/github/donkirkby/zero-play/coverage.svg?branch=master
[codecov]: https://codecov.io/github/donkirkby/zero-play?branch=master

The zero play library is based on the ideas in the [AlphaGo Zero paper] and the
example Python code in the [alpha-zero-general project]. The goal of this
project is to make a reusable Python library that other projects can build on
to make powerful computer opponents for many different board games. An example
project that uses this library is [Shibumi Games].

It includes a graphical display that you can use to play against the computer
opponent or another human.

## Installing Zero Play
Even though Zero Play has a graphical display, it is a regular Python package,
so you can install it with `pip install zero-play`. If you haven't installed
Python packages before, read Brett Cannon's [quick-and-dirty guide].

Then run it with the `zero_play_gui` command.
