Description: Local spelling
        ==============
        
        Developed by Fast Data Science, https://fastdatascience.com
        
        Source code at https://github.com/fastdatascience/localspelling
        
        Python library for localising spelling between British and American conventions, conserving case.
        
        Please note this library converts only spelling variants such as US "honour" vs UK "honor".
        
        It does not localise vocabulary such as "pavement" vs "sidewalk" or "aubergine" vs "eggplant".
        
        It also does not localise spellings where there is more than one correct conversion, such as US "program", which corresponds to both "programme" and "program" in British spelling.
