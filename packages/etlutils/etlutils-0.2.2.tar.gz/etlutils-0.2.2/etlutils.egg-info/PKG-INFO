        # etlutils
        
        This is a collection of utility functions for my etl projects. Sharing as they might be useful to others as well.
        
        ## current version
        
        The current version is 0.2.2 as this is a very early release. Use at your own risk as things will change.

        ## installing with pip

        ## contributions
        
        All contributions are welcome, please submit a PR. Issues and feature requests are fine as well, but they may take some time for me to get to. Better to submit a PR.
        
        ## requires
        
        Python 3.6 or above, I'm not using any earlier versions of python on any of my projects anymore, so supporting older versions isn't high on my list of priorities.
