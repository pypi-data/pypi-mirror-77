Description: This project was inspired by Matteyeux with his ios-tools repo, this will be a similar project but for my own practice. Also, in native Python 3 code :D
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
            1. Run: ./install.sh, which also updates, so run this each time to update
            2. You should then have a module called: "iospytools"
        
            Example: iospytools --keys iPhone2,1 3.0
        
        ### Commands
        
            --buildid device iOS  | convert an iOS to its buildid
            --clean               | if there are any leftover json files, this will get rid of them
            --codename device iOS | get codename of an iOS
            --download device iOS | download an ipsw
            --keys device iOS     | get keys for an iOS
            --shsh DEVICE ECID    | save SHSH for all signed iOS versions of a device (Disabled atm, needs updating.)
            --signed device       | print the signed versions for a device
            --split key           | splits a GID decrypted key
        
        ### TODO

            ipsw: ipsw handling and creating
        
        ### Credits
        
            Visual Studio Code: Holy! I love this IDE! (better than Pycharm...)
