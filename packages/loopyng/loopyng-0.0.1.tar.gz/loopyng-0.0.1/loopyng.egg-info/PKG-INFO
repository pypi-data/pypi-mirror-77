        Utils to generate audio
        
        Depending on what you use, you might need some libraries such as:
        ```
        librosa
        soundfile
        pyttsx3 (for voiced_time.py)
        ```
        
        If you get an import error on X, just try to do:
        ```
        pip install X
        ```
        in your terminal.
        
        If that doesn't work, google the library and see how to install it 
        For e.g. soundfile is actually obtained by doing
        ```
        pip install pysoundfile
        ```
