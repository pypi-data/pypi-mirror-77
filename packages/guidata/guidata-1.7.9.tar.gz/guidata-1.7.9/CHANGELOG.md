### Version 1.7.0 ###

Possible API compatibility issues:

* Added support for PyQt5 (removed old-style signals)


### Version 1.6.1 ###

Possible API compatibility issues:

* disthelpers:
  * Changed arguments from "architecture=None, python_version=None" to "msvc_version, architecture=None"


### Version 1.6.0 ###

Added support for Python 3 (see module `guidata.py3compat`).

New features:

* disthelpers:
  * Added support for Python 3.3
  * Added support for pygments (and partial support for zmq: still failing)
* FloatArrayItem: added support for `unit` property value

Bug fixes:

* disthelpers.prepend_module_to_path: unload modules which were already imported to be able to replace them by other versions (mostly `guidata` should be concerned by this if the function is used -as it should be- in package's __init__.py script)


### Version 1.5.1 ###

New features:

* HDF5 serialization (HDF5 reader/writer):
  * Added context manager
  * Added convenience methods `read` and `write`
  * Added convenience methods `write_object_list` and `read_object_list` to save/restore objects implementing DataSet-like `serialize` and `deserialize` methods
* Datasets I/O (HDF5/ini): None values (unset items) can now be saved/loaded for FloatItem, IntItem and BoolItem objects
* disthelpers: added option 'exclude_dirs' to 'add_module_data_files' and 'add_module_data_dir' methods
* Added slider support for FloatItem objects (contributor: julien.jaeck)
* (Issue 21) Added option 'size' in dataset `edit` and `view` methods to resize the generated dialog box (size may be a tuple of integers (width, height) or a QSize object)

Possible API compatibility issues:

* guidata now requires Python 2.6 (Python 2.5 support has been dropped)

Bug fixes:

* DataSet objects (de)serialization: fixed HDF5 reader/writer for FilesOpenItem and FloatArrayItem serialize/deserialize methods
* Fixed DataSet userconfig read/write test
* StringItem/ColorItem: fixed unicode/str issues in deserialization methods
* Added support for strings encoded in file system charset to avoid an error like "String %r is not UTF-8 encoded" when trying to set an item to a string value (path) obtained with a file system command
* configtools/image paths: handling file system encoded paths
* (Issue 14) Restored compatiblity with PyQt v4.4


### Version 1.5.0 ###

Bug fixes:

* Fixed 'callback' property related issue: when updating a DataSetShowGroupBox or
DataSetEditGroupBox internal dataset, the callback property was causing a reset
of the data items to their default values

Possible API compatibility issues:

* datatypes.OperatorProperty was renamed to FuncProp

Other changes:

* Added test for the FuncProp item property: how to change an item active state depending on another item's value
* Added support for dictionaries for `update_dataset` and `restore_dataset` (functions of `guidata.utils`):
  * `update_dataset` may update the destination dataset from a source dictionary
  * `restore_dataset` may update the destination dictionary from a source dataset
* FloatArrayItem: added option "large" to show all the array values in read-only mode
* Added new guidata svg logo
* disthelpers:
  * added support for PySide
	* disthelpers: new function 'get_visual_studio_dlls' -- returns the list of Visual
Studio DLLs (and create manifest) associated to Python architecture and version
	

### Version 1.4.2 ###

Bug fixes:

* disthelpers:
  * the vs2008 option was accidently turned off by default on Windows platforms
  * build_chm.bat: added support for Windows x64

Other changes:

* dataset.qtwidgets:
  * QLabel widgets word wrapping is now disabled for read-only items and may be disabled for dataset comments: this is necessary because when the parent widget height is constrained, Qt is unexpectedly reducing the height of word-wrapped QLabel widgets below their minimum size, hence truncating their contents...
* disthelpers:
  * raising an exception when the right version of Ms Visual C++ DLLs was not found
  * now creating the manifest and distributing from the redistribuable package installed in WinSxS


### Version 1.4.1 ###

Bug fixes:

* ColorItem for recent versions of Qt: in QLineEdit widget, the text representation of color was str(QColor(...)) instead of str(QColor(...).name())
* guidata.qt compat package: fixed _modname typo
* hdf5io:
  * optional attribute mechanism generalized to both Attr and DSet objects (for both saving and loading data)
  * H5Store/`close` method: now checking if h5 file has already been closed before trying to close it (see http://code.google.com/p/h5py/issues/detail?id=220)
* disthelpers:
  * vs2008 option was ignored
  * added 'C:\Program Files (x86)' to bin includes (cx_Freeze)
* Data items/callbacks: fixed callbacks for ChoiceItem (or derived items) which were triggered when other widgets were triggering their own callbacks...

Other changes:

* Added test for item callbacks
* dataset.datatypes.FormatProp/new behavior: added `ignore_error` argument, default to True (ignores string formatting error: ValueError)
* disthelpers:
  * Distribution.Setup: added `target_dir` option
  * Distribution.build: added `create_archive` option to create a ZIP archive after building the package
  * cx_Freeze: added support for multiple executables
  * added support for h5py 2.0
  * added support for Maplotlib 1.1
* Allow DateTime edit widgets to popup calendar


### Version 1.4.0 ###

Possible API compatibility issues:

* disthelpers: removed functions remove_build_dist, add_module_data_files,
    add_text_data_file, get_default_excludes, get_default_includes, 
    get_default_dll_excludes, create_vs2008_data_files (...) which were 
    replaced by a class named Distribution, 
    see the new disthelpers test for more details (tests/dishelpers.py)
* reorganized utils and configtools modules

Other changes:

* disthelpers: replaced almost all functions by a class named Distribution,
    and added support for cx_Freeze (module remains compatible with py2exe),
    see the new disthelpers test for more details (tests/dishelpers.py)
* reorganized utils and configtools modules


### Version 1.3.2 ###

Since this version, `guidata` is compatible with PyQt4 API #1 *and* API #2.
Please read carefully the coding guidelines which have been recently added to 
the documentation.

Possible API compatibility issues:

* Removed deprecated wrappers around QFileDialog's static methods (use the wrappers provided by `guidata.qt.compat` instead):
  * getExistingDirectory, getOpenFileName, getOpenFileNames, getSaveFileName

Bug fixes:

* qtwidgets.ShowFloatArrayWidget: fixed string float formatting issue (replaced %f by %g)
* Fixed compatiblity issues with PyQt v4.4 (Contributor: Carlos Pascual)
* Fixed missing 'child_title' attribute error with FileOpenItem, FilesOpenItem, FileSaveItem and DirectoryItem
* (Fixes Issue 8) disthelpers.add_modules was failing when vs2008=False

Other changes:

* added *this* changelog
* qtwidgets: removed ProgressPopUp dialog (it is now recommended to use QProgressDialog instead, which is pretty much identical)
* Replaced QScintilla by spyderlib (as a dependency for array editor, code editor (test launcher) and dict editor)
* qtwidgets.DockWidgetMixin: added method 'setup_dockwidget' to change dockwidget's features, location and allowed areas after class instantiation
* guidata.utils.utf8_to_unicode: translated error message in english
* Add support for 'int' in hdf5 save function
* guidata.dataset/Numeric items (FloatItem, IntItem): added option 'unit' (automatically add suffix ' (unit)' to label in edit mode and suffix ' unit' to value in read-only mode)
* Improved dataset __str__ method: code refactoring with read-only dataset widgets (DataItem: added methods 'format_string' and 'get_string_value', DataSet: added method 'to_string')
* Added coding guidelines to the documentation
* guidata.dataset.qtwidget: added specific widget (ShowBooleanWidget) for read-only display of bool items (text is striked out when value is False)
* guidata.hdf5io.Dset: added missing keyword argument 'optional' (same effect as parent class Attr)
* guidata.dataset.dataitems.IntItem objects: added support for sliders (fixes Issue 9) with option slider=True (see documentation)


### Version 1.3.1 ###

Bug fixes:

* setup.py: added svg icons to data files
* gettext helpers were not working on Linux (Windows install pygettext was hardcoded)

* Added missing option 'basedir' for FilesOpenItem
* DirectoryItem: fixed missing child_title attribute bug
* For all DataSet GUI representation, the comment text is now word-wrapped

* Bugfix/tests: always keep a reference to the QApplication instance

Other changes:

* setup.py: added source archive download url
