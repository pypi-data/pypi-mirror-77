Description: # GNUTTY
        Pure Python HTTP Server
        
        # How do I use this?
        So long as you have Python3.4 or higher, there are no
        dependencies to worry about. Gnutty uses nothing but Python
        
        To start the example server, run
        ```
        python3 ./srv/gnutty.py
        ```
        From the root of the repository.
        
        You can confirm that it is running by opening
        `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a browser and checking you
        receive the plaintext response of `OK`
        
        You can also run
        ```bash
        curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000
        ```
        To confirm the response from the Gnutty Server
        ```
        ~ î‚° curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
        * TCP_NODELAY set
