# GNUTTY
Pure Python HTTP Server

# How do I use this?
So long as you have Python3.4 or higher, there are no
dependencies to worry about. Gnutty uses nothing but Python

To start the example server, run
```
python3 ./srv/gnutty.py
```
From the root of the repository.

You can confirm that it is running by opening
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a browser and checking you
receive the plaintext response of `OK`

You can also run
```bash
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
To confirm the response from the Gnutty Server
```
~ î‚° curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000

* TCP_NODELAY set
