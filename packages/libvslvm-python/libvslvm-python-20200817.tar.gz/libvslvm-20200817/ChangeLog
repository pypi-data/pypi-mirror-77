TODO
* check signature
  - check the first 4 sectors
  - update documentation regarding PV signature
* pyvslvm
  - complete segment object methods
  - complete stripe object methods
  - complete volume group object methods
* finish:
  - libvslvm_internal_logical_volume_read_buffer_from_file_io_handle
  - make sure to set the right offset in internal_logical_volume->chunks_vector 

Library:
* add support to specify metadata in external configuration file
* implement multi physical volume files support
  - map pv names to file IO pool?
* logical volume
  - expose creation_host
  - expose creation_time
  - implement multi stripe support
* metadata
  - parse and expose global values
  - make sure metadata is cleaned on close - also if no data files were set!
  - metadata: handle trailing comment in more places?
* API
  - allow for multiple input images (physical volumes)
  - allow open to read a text file with the metadata

Tools:
* vslvminfo
  - print stripes and in-volume offsets
* vslvmmount
  - allow use of logical volume names instead of lvm#?

Tests:
* add tests for library
* add tests for Python bindings
* add tests for tools

Deployment:
