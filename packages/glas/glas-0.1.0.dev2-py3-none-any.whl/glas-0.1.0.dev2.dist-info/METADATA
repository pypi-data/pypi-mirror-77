# Genetic Lookup for Amorphous Substances (GLAS)
Python module for solving the inverse design of glasses.

## What is it?
GLAS offers a helper class to facilitate the inverse design of new glasses. All the genetic algorithm code is handled by the [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) module.

## How to install
The source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/drcassar/glas.

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/glas/). To install GLAS using pip run

```sh
pip install glas
```

## Dependencies
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/)
- [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)

## Examples
See the [examples](https://github.com/drcassar/glas/tree/master/examples) directory.
