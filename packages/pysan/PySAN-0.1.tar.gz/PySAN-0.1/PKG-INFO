Description: # PySAN: social sequence analysis in Python
        
        PySAN is a library of methods for performing basic social sequence analysis using Python.
        
        ## What it does
        - basic visualisation of a sequence
        - computation of sequence alphabets and ngrams
        - calculations of ngram and sequence universes
        - transition matrix calculations and plots
        - more coming soon
        
        ## Why PySAN
        PySAN was created as a hobbyist project by [Oliver Scholten](https://twitter.com/ojscholten) after reading *Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Applications* by *Benjamin Cornwell*. It's not meant as a state of the art scientific package, but more of a reliable workhorse for preliminary investigations and small projects.
