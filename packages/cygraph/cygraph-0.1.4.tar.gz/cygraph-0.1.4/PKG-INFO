Description: # cygraph
        
        *A graph theory library implemented in Cython*
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install cygraph
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here is a basic example of some features in cygraph.
        ```python
        >>> import cygraph as cg
        >>> import cygraph.algorithms as alg
        >>> G = cg.graph(vertices=list(range(4)))
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)
        >>> G.add_edge(2, 3)
        >>> G.add_edge(3, 1)
        >>> G.get_children(1)
        {2, 3}
        >>> alg.get_number_components(G)
        2
        ```

        ## Contribution
        
        I am currently not accepting any pull requests. This project is still in its very early stages and I have many things in mind to do with it. Once I get those things done, I will add contribution guidelines.
