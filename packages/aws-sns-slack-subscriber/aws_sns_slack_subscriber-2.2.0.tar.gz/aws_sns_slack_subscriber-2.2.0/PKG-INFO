        ### Description
        
        When you have SNS Topics, you may subscribe to them with various ways. For example, 
        email subscription will send an email to a desired email address when a notification 
        is pushed to a SNS Topic. Most of the time email subscription is not ideal as it may 
        clutter your email box. Hence, there are other ways to subscribe to a SNS Topic. We 
        think the most convenient way to subscribe to SNS Topic is a Lambda Function integration
        which sends callbacks to your specified Slack channel. This library project is about that.
        It creates a "Slack subscription" with a help of Lambda.
        
        ### Examples
        
        Create sns slack subscriber as any other lambda function:
        
        ```python
        from aws_sns_slack_subscriber.slack_subscriber import SlackSubscriber
        
        lambda_function_slack_subscirber = SlackSubscriber(...)
        ```
