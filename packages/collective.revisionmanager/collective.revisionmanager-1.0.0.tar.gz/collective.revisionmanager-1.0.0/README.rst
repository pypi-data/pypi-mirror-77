collective.revisionmanager is a Plone add-on that lets you manage Products.CMFEditions histories. It can be used with Plone 5.0 and Plone 4.3. You will need Products.CMFEditions version >= 2.2.16.

Features
--------

- Sorted listing of histories storage (portal_historiesstorage) contents. Sort by: history id, number of versions, history size, size state, portal type or path
- Purge revisions or delete entire histories
- Maintain a cache for the statistics
- Plone controlpanel interface for portal_purgepolicy

Translations
------------

Brazilian Portuguese, German and Spanish translations are available.

Installation
------------

Install collective.revisionmanager by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.revisionmanager

and then running ``bin/buildout``. During installation, ``collective.revisionmanager`` will check wether the ``cmf_uid`` catalog index is there - if not, the index will be added and indexed. This step may require a considerable amount of time depending on the number of objects and object revisions in your database. Also, a cache for the statistics will be created.

After installation, you will have to calculate the statistics initially before you can see anything. Statistics calculation was done automatically during installation in earlier releases, but for sites with large databases and limited memory it may be necessary to configure subtransactions prior to updating the cache.

Calculating Statistics
----------------------

Before you can use `collective.revisionmanager` you need to fill its history statistics cache. You can do so by visting Plone Control Panel -> Addon Configuration -> Manage Revisions and then clicking on the ``Recalculate Statistics`` button. Calculation may take a lot of time if you have lots of objects and object revisions in your database.

You will have to recalculate statistics from time to time to keep them up to date at intervals depending on database activity.

**Dealing with catalog inconsistencies**

If the installation fails with an ``AttributeError`` in ``Products.ZCatalog.CatalogBrains``, your ``portal_catalog`` is inconsistent and you need to `rebuild <http://docs.plone.org/develop/plone/searching_and_indexing/catalog.html>`_ it. As a quick workaround, you can also simply clear (or even delete) the ``cmf_uid`` catalog index - ``collective.revisionmanager`` will rebuild it during installation. But be aware that your ``portal_catalog`` is still inconsistent and needs rebuilding.

Always make sure the ``cmf_uid`` index is consistent because it is used to determine the working copy of a history. Incorrectly indexed content will show up as having no working copy in the histories list!
