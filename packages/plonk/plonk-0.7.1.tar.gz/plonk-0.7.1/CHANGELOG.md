## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2020-08-21

### Added

- Use a TOML config file to configure options.
- Add default_units and set_units on Snap and Profile.
- Sinks are iterable.
- Plot error bars on profiles.

### Changed

- Renamed subsnaps_by_type to subsnaps_as_dict.
- Renamed units_defaults to array_units.
- Name mapping, units, aliases are no longer hard coded and are now in config.toml.
- If no units specified in image/plot/vector functions then use the default units on the Snap if available.
- Renamed some analysis.particles functions.
- Sinks analysis functions take a Sinks object as arguments.
- Profile.plot "std_dev_shading" argument changed to "std", and now is a string not a bool.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in using Snap for snaps with no sinks.
- Fixed bug in accessing a single Sink if a np.int rather than int was passed in.
- Fixed bug in reading Phantom datasets without knowing units.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-08-17

### Added

- Added plonk.image to make image plots (with interpolation and then matplotlib imshow).
- Added plonk.vector to make vector plots (with interpolation and then matplotlib quiver).
- Added plot_smoothing_length function to plot the smoothing length on particles, or accretion radius on sink particles.
- Added pretty_array_name function to prettify array names.
- Added visualize_sim as a method on Simulation objects.
- Allow getting subsets of Sinks.
- Added ax_kwargs to plotting functions for passing to ax.set.
- Added xlim, ylim on visualize.plot.
- Added units_dict function to return a units dictionary for passing to plotting functions.
- Added bulk load and unload functions on Snap for loading/unloading multiple arrays into/out-of memory.
- Add context manager for caching arrays on Snap.
- Added public methods on Snap: family for accessing particle families, and array for accessing particle arrays. These are already accessible via __getitem__ but this makes the underlying methods available.
- Add function to add missing units to array on Snap.

### Changed

- Removed plonk.particle_plot in favour of plonk.plot.
- Changed plonk.plot to produce particle plots
- Renamed MultiVisualization and plot_snaps to VisualizeSimulation and visualize_sim.
- Changed units system from cgs to SI.
- Simplified animation functions by only allowing one axes per animation.
- Changed default units to more conventional SI units, e.g. Pascal for pressure and Joule for energy.
- Simplified tree and neighbours functions on Snap. Now there is only one tree for a Snap. If you want a tree for just, say, dust particles, then first create a SubSnap and get the tree on that.
- Changed _Sinks into Sinks, i.e. a public class.
- All plotting functions/methods use the same argument for setting units.
- Renamed Snap.available_arrays argument "all" to "verbose".
- Changed Snap.units to Snap.code_units.
- Use pretty_array_name for plots labels.
- Rename Snap.unset to Snap.reset and allow for unloading cached arrays.
- When setting Snap.cache_arrays to False, no longer unload currently cached arrays.

### Fixed

- Fixed writing Snap.to_dataframe units.

## [0.6.2] - 2020-08-11

### Changed

- Use setup.cfg for setuptools, and pyproject.toml (and setup.cfg) for config of tools.
- Version is set in setup.cfg and imported into plonk via importlib_metadata.
- Changed API documentation.
- Moved sph module from utils sub-package to analysis.

### Deprecated

- plonk.particle_plot will be removed.
- plonk.plot will change from image plots to particle plots, and plonk.image and plonk.vector will be added to replace plonk.plot.
- Default units will change from cgs to SI.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in Profile with getting number of mixture dust species.
- Fixed bugs in animation functions (due to making physical units on by default).
- Fixed issues with colorbar size matching height of plots.

## [0.6.1] - 2020-08-09

### Added

- Snap.sinks attribute has more features.
- Cross section interpolation in a non-xy plane specified by a normal vector to the plane.
- Snap.rotate can be set by an axis vector and angle as opposed to a scipy Rotation object.
- discs module to analysis.
- filters module to analysis to set SubSnaps easily.
- 'id' array on Snap to help track particles.
- Function to plot the smoothing length as a circle.
- Profile method to generate a function from a profile to help create particle filters, for example.
- Simulation method to create a particle array over the whole simulation.

### Changed

- Snap.available_arrays does not reference sink particles; see Snap.sinks.available_arrays.
- Profile.plot units are now consistent with visualize functions.
- Dust profiles in Profile are now distinguished by whether they are mixture (dust/gas) particles or dust-only particles.

### Fixed

- Setting origin in extra quantities.
- All analysis functions have better physical units support.
- Bug in Snap.num_particles_of_type.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-08-05

### Added

- Added plot and particle_plot as methods of the Snap class. This allows for plotting with `snap.plot(quantity='quantity')` as opposed to `plonk.visualize.plot(snap=snap, quantity='quantity)`.
- Axis and colorbars have labels by default now, including units.
- The to_dataframe Snap method now indicates units in the column names, e.g. `position [au]`.
- The available_arrays method of Snap has additional arguments to see all sub-arrays on particles, e.g. `velocity_x` and `dust_fraction_001`.
- Added to examples and quick-start in documentation.
- Added method to re-open a closed Snap file.

### Changed

- Physical units are turned on by default on Snap objects. All particle and sink arrays have units (provided by Pint).
- The units attribute of Snap and Simulation now only has core units, i.e. length, time, mass, and magnetic field.
- Some extra quantities have been renamed.
- Extra quantities are available on Snap objects by default.
- The arguments radius_min and radius_max in Profile have been renamed cmin and cmax to reflect that profiles are not just radial.

### Fixed

- Fixed setting pressure from Phantom equation of states.

## [0.5.3] - 2020-07-28

### Fixed

- Fixed major bug in setting extra dust arrays on a Snap.

## [0.5.2] - 2020-07-28

### Added

- Change log.
- Cartesian profiles in y- and z-direction, in addition to x-direction which was already implemented.

### Changed

- Do not raise exception in extra_quantities and physical_units if already set.
- Scikit-image and tqdm are no longer required dependencies.
- Conda environment renamed from plonk-dev to plonk.
- Refactor Plonk namespace. Fewer modules are directly imported.

## [0.5.1] - 2020-07-11

### Added

- Analysis functions for sink particles.
- Function to animate particle plots.
- Different colours per particle type in particle plots.
- Tqdm progress bar for animation.

### Changed

- Use Matplotlib consistent argument names in particle_plot.

### Fixed

- Fix bug in standard deviation shading in Profile.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-04-20

### Added

- Neighbour finding via kd-tree.
- Compute SPH derivatives using kd-tree.
- IPython tab completion for Snap arrays and Profile profiles.
- Profile can have ndim==1 which gives a linear profile, useful for box calculations.
- Option to turn off caching of particle arrays, so that they are always read from file.
- Write derived arrays to HDF5 file, and read arrays from that file onto a Snap.
- Added logging of warning and other information messages.

### Changed

- Generalize sub-types: dust_type â†’ sub_type: this allows for Phantom boundary particle sub-types.

### Removed

- Remove `Visualization` class in favour of just returning matplotlib's Axes and Figure objects.

## [0.4.1] - 2020-03-24

### Added

- Add scatter plots, i.e. particle plots with variable color and size markers.
- Add `extra_quantities` method to easily calculate extra quantities on the snapshot.
- Allow for setting array units, whether the array is rotatable, and whether it is a dust on derived arrays.
- Profiles are automatically generated from any 1d Snap quantity.
- Access individual dust quantities on profiles via '_001', etc.
- Read Phantom equation of state information to get pressure, sound speed, temperature.
- Add extra Snap quantities, e.g. Stokes number.
- Add extra profiles, e.g. Toomre Q.
- Allow accessing components of Snap quantities via '_x', etc.
- Calculate standard deviation on profiles.

### Changed

- Use verbose names for all snapshot quantities, e.g. 'dust_fraction' not 'dustfrac' and 'velocity_divergence' not 'divv'.

### Removed

- Remove `Evolution` object in favour of pandas DataFrame.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-03-15
