# Password_Safe_Box

# Description:
Password_Safe_Box is a library that helps you store passwords with a lot more security than just making a hash,
currently (Version 0.2 Alpha) it only has 3 functions, the 1st is the help menu that prints all the functions,
the 2nd function takes the password as argument and returns an enhanced hash that would take years to crack even
for a 1 letter length password.

# Usage:
Help: Print out all the available functions (Add the function's name as argument to get more info)
Password: Returns an enhanced hash generated from the given password

# requirements:
python 3.x

hashlib (library)
