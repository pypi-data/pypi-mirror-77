Description: # pyucs
        
        This is a custom ucs module that adds some functionality to the ucsmsdk.
        The ucsmsdk module is a series of basic methods such as query_dn or query_classid. There isn't a whole lot of additional 
        capabilities. So pyucs attempts to address some fo this such as providing a get_vnic or get_service_profile methods
        that allows more targeted approaches. This module is still a work in progress but is a good start.
        Again this is a custom module so there are some things that fit with only my environment such as the pyucs.credentials module
        that relies upon my own credentialstore API.
