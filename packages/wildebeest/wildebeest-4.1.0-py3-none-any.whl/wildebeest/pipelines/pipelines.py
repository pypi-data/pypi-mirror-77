class Pipeline:
    """
    Class for defining file processing pipelines.

    Attributes
    ----------
    load_func
        Callable that takes a string or `Path` object as single
        positional argument, reads from the corresponding location, and
        returns some representation of its contents.
    write_func
        Callable that takes the output of the last element of `ops` (or
        the output of `load_func` if `ops` is `None` or empty) and a
        string or `Path` object and writes the former to the location
        specified by the latter.
    ops
        Iterable of callables each of which takes a single positional
        argument. The first element of `ops` must accept the output of
        `load_func`, and each subsequent element must accept the output
        of the immediately preceding element. It is recommended that
        every element of `ops` take and return one common data structure
        (e.g. NumPy arrays for image data) so that those elements can
        be recombined easily.

        Run the pipeline.

        Across `n_jobs` threads, for each path in `inpaths`, if
        `skip_func(path, path_func(path))` is `True`, skip that path.
        Otherwise, use `load_func` to get the resource from that path,
        pipe its output through `ops`, and write out the result with
        `write_func`.

        ----------
        inpaths
            Iterable of string or Path objects pointing to resources to
            be processed and written out.
        path_func
            Function that takes each input path and returns the desired
            corresponding output path.
        n_jobs
            Number of threads to use.
        skip_func
            Callable that takes an input path and a prospective output
            path and returns a Boolean indicating whether or not that
            file should be skipped; for instance, use
            `lambda inpath, outpath: Path(outpath).is_file()` to avoid
            overwriting existing files.
        exceptions_to_catch
            Tuple of exception types to catch. An exception of one of
            these types will be added to the run report, but the
            pipeline will continue to execute. All exceptions will be
            logged whether they are caught or not.
