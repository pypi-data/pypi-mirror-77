    This returns a FingerprintReader which can be iterated over to get
    the id and fingerprint for each read structure record. The
    fingerprint generated depends on the value of 'type'. Structures
    are read from 'source', which can either be the structure
    filename, or None to read from stdin.

    'type' contains the information about how to turn a structure
    into a fingerprint. It can be a string or a metadata instance.
    String values look like "OpenBabel-FP2/1", "OpenEye-Path", and
    "OpenEye-Path/1 min_bonds=0 max_bonds=5 atype=DefaultAtom btype=DefaultBond".
    Default values are used for unspecified parameters. Use a
    Metadata instance with 'type' and 'aromaticity' values set
    in order to pass aromaticity information to OpenEye.

    If 'format' is None then the structure file format and compression
    are determined by the filename's extension(s), defaulting to
    uncompressed SMILES if that is not possible. Otherwise 'format' may
    be "smi" or "sdf" optionally followed by ".gz" or "bz2" to indicate
    compression. The OpenBabel and OpenEye toolkits also support
    additional formats.
    
    If 'id_tag' is None, then the record id is based on the title
    field for the given format. If the input format is "sdf" then 'id_tag'
    specifies the tag field containing the identifier. (Only the first
    line is used for multi-line values.) For example, ChEBI omits the
    title from the SD files and stores the id after the ">  <ChEBI ID>"
    line. In that case, use id_tag = "ChEBI ID".

    'aromaticity' specifies the aromaticity model, and is only appropriate for
    OEChem. It must be a string like "openeye" or "daylight".

    Here is an example of using fingerprints generated from structure file::
    
        fp_reader = read_molecule_fingerprints("OpenBabel-FP4/1", "example.sdf.gz")
        print "Each fingerprint has", fps.metadata.num_bits, "bits"

    Read fingerprints from *source*, using the given format. If
    *source* is a string then it is treated as a filename. If *source*
    is None then fingerprints are read from stdin. Otherwise, *source*
    must be a Python file object supporting the ``read`` and
    ``readline`` methods.

    If *format* is None then the fingerprint file format and
    compression type are derived from the source filename, or from the
    ``name`` attribute of the source file object. If the source is None
    then the stdin is assumed to be uncompressed data in "fps" format.

    The supported format strings are "fps", "fps.gz" for fingerprints
    in FPS format and compressed FPS format, respectively.

    This version of chemfp does not support the FPB format. Trying
    to use the "fpb" format will raise a NotImplementedError.

    format is also supported.

    The optional *location* is a :class:`chemfp.io.Location` instance.
    It will only be used if the source is in FPS format.

    If the source is in FPS format then ``open`` will return a
    :class:`chemfp.fps_io.FPSReader`, which will use the *location*

    For each query in 'queries', find the 'k'-nearest of all the targets
    in 'targets' which are at least 'threshold' similar to the query. Ties
    are broken arbitrarily and hits with scores equal to the smallest value
    may have been omitted.
    
    This function returns an iterator containing the (query_id, hits) pairs,
    where hits is a list of (target_id, score) pairs, sorted so that the
    highest scores are first. The order of ties is arbitrary.

    Example::

      # Use the first 5 fingerprints as the queries 
      queries = next(chemfp.open("pubchem_subset.fps").iter_arenas(5))
      targets = chemfp.load_fingerprints("pubchem_subset.fps")

              print "    The least similar is", target_id, "with score", score

    Internally, queries are processed in batches of size 'arena_size'.
    A small batch size uses less overall memory and has lower
    processing latency, while a large batch size has better overall
    performance. Use arena_size=None to process the input as a single batch.

    Note: the FPSReader may be used as a target but it can only process
    one batch, and searching a FingerprintArena is faster if you have more
    than a few queries.
