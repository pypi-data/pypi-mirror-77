Generating fingerprint files from PubChem SD files
==================================================

In this section you'll learn how to create a fingerprint file from an
SD file which contains pre-computed CACTVS fingerprints. You do not
need a chemistry toolkit for this section.

`PubChem <http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ is a great resource
of publically available chemistry information. The data is available
for `ftp download <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`_. We'll use some of
their `SD formatted
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_Data_File#SDF>`_ files.
Each record has a PubChem/CACTVS fingerprint field, which we'll extract
to generate an FPS file.
 
Start by downloading the files 
Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz 
(from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF/Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz  
)
and Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz 
(from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF/Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz  
). At the time of writing they contain 10,826 and 14,967 records,
respectively. (I chose some of the smallest files so they would be
easier to open and review.)


Start by downloading the files 
Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz 
(from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF/Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz  
)
and Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz 
(from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF/Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz  
). At the time of writing they contain 10,826 and 14,967 records,
respectively. (I chose some of the smallest files so they would be
easier to open and review.)

Next, convert the files into fingerprint files. On the command line
do the following two commands::

    sdf2fps --pubchem Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz -o pubchem_queries.fps
    sdf2fps --pubchem Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz -o pubchem_targets.fps

Congratulations, that was it!

How does this work? Each PubChem record contains the precomputed
CACTVS substructure keys in the PUBCHEM_CACTVS_SUBSKEYS tag. The
:option:`--pubchem` flag tells sdf2fps to get the value of that tag and decode
it to get the fingerprint. It also adds a few metadata fields to the
fingerprint file header. Here's are the first few lines of
pubchem_queries.fps. The header lines start with "#", followed by the
fingerprint lines. The fingerprints are hex-encoded, followed by a
tab, followed by an identifier.::

    #FPS1
    #num_bits=881
    #type=CACTVS-E_SCREEN/1.0 extended=2
    #software=CACTVS/unknown
    #source=Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz

    07de1c000200000000000000000000000080040000003c0200000000000000800300007820080200

The order of the fingerprints are the same as the order of the
corresponding record in the SDF, although unconvertable records might
be skipped, depending on the :option:`--errors` flag.

If you store records in an SD file then you almost certainly don't use
the same fingerprint encoding as PubChem. sdf2ps can decode from a
number of encodings. Use :option:`--help` to see the list of available
decoders.


k-nearest neighbor search
=========================

In this section you'll learn how to search a fingerprint file to find
the k-nearest neighbors. You will need the fingerprint files generated
in :ref:`pubchem_fingerprints` but you do not need a chemistry
toolkit.

We'll use the pubchem_queries.fps as the queries for a k=2 nearest
neighor similarity search of the target file puchem_targets.gps::

   simsearch -k 2 -q pubchem_queries.fps pubchem_targets.fps

That's all! You should get output which starts::

    #Simsearch/1
    #num_bits=881
    #type=Tanimoto k=2 threshold=0.0
    #software=chemfp/1.6
    #queries=pubchem_queries.fps
    #targets=pubchem_targets.fps
    #query_source=Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz
    #target_source=Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz
    2	99000039	48503376	0.8785	48503380	0.8729
    2	99000230	48563034	0.8588	48731730	0.8523
    2	99002251	48798046	0.8110	48625236	0.8107
    2	99003537	48997075	0.9036	48997697	0.8985

How do you interpret the output? The lines starting with '#' are
header lines. It contains metadata information describing that this is
a similarity search report. You can see the search parameters, the
name of the tool which did the search, and the filenames which went
into the search.

After the '#' header lines come the search results, with one result
per line. There are in the same order as the query fingerprints. Each
result line contains tab-delimited columns. The first column is the
number of hits. The second column is the query identifier used. The
remaining columns contain the hit data, with alternating target id and
its score.

For example, the first result line contains the 2 hits for the
query 99000039. The first hit is the target id 48503376 with score
0.8785 and the second hit is 48503380 with score 0.8729. Since this is
a k-nearest neighor search, the hits are sorted by score, starting
with the highest score. Do be aware that ties are broken
arbitrarily. There may be additional hits with the score 0.8729 which
are not reported.


Threshold search
================

In this section you'll learn how to search a fingerprint file to find
all of the neighbors at or above a given threshold. You will need the
fingerprint files generated in :ref:`pubchem_fingerprints` but you do
not need a chemistry toolkit.

Let's do a threshold search and find all hits which are at least 0.85
similar to the queries::

    simsearch --threshold 0.85 -q pubchem_queries.fps pubchem_targets.fps

The first 15 lines of output from this are::

    #Simsearch/1
    #num_bits=881
    #type=Tanimoto k=all threshold=0.85
    #software=chemfp/1.6
    #queries=pubchem_queries.fps
    #targets=pubchem_targets.fps
    #query_source=Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz
    #target_source=Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz
    4	99000039	48732162	0.8596	48503380	0.8729	48503376
    	0.8785	48520532	0.8541
    2	99000230	48563034	0.8588	48731730	0.8523
    0	99002251
    4	99003537	48566113	0.8724	48998000	0.8535	48997697
    	0.8985	48997075	0.9036
    4	99003538	48566113	0.8724	48998000	0.8535	48997697
    	0.8985	48997075	0.9036
    0	99005028
    0	99005031
    
Take a look at the first result line, which contains the 4 hits for
the query id 99000039. As before, the hit information alternates
between the target ids and the target scores, but unlike the k-nearest
search, the hits are not in a particular order. You can see that here
where the scores are 0.8596, 0.8729, 0.8785, and 0.8541.

You might be wondering why I chose the 0.85 threshold, or decided to
show only the first 15 lines of output. Quite simply, it was for
presentation. With a threshold of 0.8, the first record has 41 hits,
which requires 84 columns to show, which is a bit overwhelming.

Combined k-nearest and threshold search
=======================================

In this section you'll learn how to search a fingerprint file to find
the k-nearest neighbors, where all of the hits must be at or above
given threshold. You will need the fingerprint files generated in
:ref:`pubchem_fingerprints` but you do not need a chemistry toolkit.


You can combine the :option:`-k` and :option:`--threshold` queries to
find the k-nearest neighbors which are all above a given threshold::

    simsearch -k 3 --threshold 0.7 -q pubchem_queries.fps pubchem_targets.fps

This find the nearest 3 structures, which all must be at least 0.7
similar to the query fingerprint. The output from the above starts::

    #Simsearch/1
    #num_bits=881
    #type=Tanimoto k=3 threshold=0.7
    #software=chemfp/1.6
    #queries=pubchem_queries.fps
    #targets=pubchem_targets.fps
    #query_source=Compound_099000001_099500000.sdf.gz
    #target_source=Compound_048500001_049000000.sdf.gz
    3	99000039	48503376	0.8785	48503380	0.8729	48732162	0.8596
    3	99000230	48563034	0.8588	48731730	0.8523	48583483	0.8412
    3	99002251	48798046	0.8110	48625236	0.8107	48500395	0.7927
    3	99003537	48997075	0.9036	48997697	0.8985	48566113	0.8724
    3	99003538	48997075	0.9036	48997697	0.8985	48566113	0.8724
    3	99005028	48651160	0.8288	48848576	0.8167	48660867	0.8000
    3	99005031	48651160	0.8288	48848576	0.8167	48660867	0.8000
    3	99006292	48945841	0.9652	48737522	0.8793	48575758	0.8537
    3	99006293	48945841	0.9652	48737522	0.8793	48575758	0.8537
    0	99006597
    3	99006753	48655580	0.9310	48662591	0.9249	48654553	0.9096
    3	99009085	48561250	0.8503	48588162	0.8027	48675288	0.7973

The output format is identical to the previous two search examples,
and because this is a k-nearest search, the hits are sorted from
higest score to lowest.

NxN (self-similar) searches
===========================

Use the --NxN option if you want to use the same fingerprints as both
the queries and targets::

    simsearch -k 3 --threshold 0.7 --NxN pubchem_queries.fps

This is about twice as fast and uses half as much memory compared to::

    simsearch -k 3 --threshold 0.7 -q pubchem_queries.fps pubchem_queries.fps

Plus, the --NxN option excludes matching a fingerprint to itself (the
diagonal term).

.. _chebi_fingerprints:

Using a toolkit to process the ChEBI dataset
============================================

In this section you'll learn how to create a fingerprint file from a
structure file. The structure processing and fingerprint generation
are done with a third-party chemisty toolkit. chemfp supports Open
Babel, OpenEye, and RDKit. (OpenEye users please note that you will
need an OEGraphSim license to use the OpenEye-specific
fingerprinters.)

NOTE: All of these toolkit vendors dropped support for Python 2.7 
by 2019, so this is mostly of historical note.

We'll work with data from ChEBI http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/ which
contains "Chemical Entities of Biological Interest". They distribute
their structures in several formats, including as an SD file. For this
section, download the "lite" version from
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chebi/SDF/ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz . It
contains the same structure data as the complete version but many
fewer tag data fields.  For ChEBI 155 this file contains 95,955 records
and the compressed file is 28MB.

Unlike the PubChem data set, the ChEBI data set does not contain
fingerprints so we'll need to generate them using a toolkit.

ChEBI record titles don't contain the id
----------------------------------------

Strangely, the ChEBI dataset does not use the title line of the SD
file to store the record id. A simple examination shows that 47,376 of
the title lines are empty, 39,615 have the title "null", 4,499 have
the title " ", 2,033 have the title "ChEBI", 45 of them are labeled
"Structure #1", and the others are usually compound names.

(I've asked ChEBI to fix this, to no success. Perhaps you have more
influence?)

Instead, the id is stored as the value of the "ChEBI ID" tag, which
in the SD file looks like::

    > <ChEBI ID>
    CHEBI:776

By default the toolkit-based fingerprint generation tools use the
title as the identifier, and print a warning and skip the record if
the identifier is missing. Here's an example with :ref:`rdkit2fps
<rdkit2fps>`::

    ERROR: Missing title in SD record, file 'ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz', line 1, record #1. Skipping.

That output I showed contains only three fingerprint records, the
first two with the id "ChEBI" and the last with the id of 'null'. The
earlier records had no title or the title was a space character, so
they were skipped, with a message sent to stderr describing the
problem and the location of the record containing the problem.

(If the first 100 records have no identifiers then the command-line
tools will exit even if :option:`--errors` is ignore. This is a safety
mechanism. Let me know if it's a problem.)

Instead, use the :option:`--id-tag` option to specify of the name of
the data tag containing the id. For this data set you'll need to write
it as::

    --id-tag "ChEBI ID"

The quotes are important because of the space in the tag name. For
example::

    rdkit2fps --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz

Here's what the first few lines of that output looks like::

    [22:58:35]  S group MUL ignored on line 103
    [22:58:35]  Unhandled CTAB feature: S group SRU on line: 31. Molecule skipped.

In addition to "ChEBI ID" there's also a "ChEBI Name" tag which
includes data values like "tropic acid" and
"(+)-guaia-6,9-diene". Every ChEBI record has a unique name so the
names could also be used as the primary identifier.

The FPS fingerprint file format allows identifiers with a space, or
comma, or anything other tab, newline, and a couple of other special
bytes, so it's no problem using those names directly.

To use the ChEBI Name as the primary chemfp identifier, specify::

    --id-tag "ChEBI Name"


Generating fingerprints with Open Babel
---------------------------------------

If you have the Open Babel Python library installed then you can use
:ref:`ob2fps <ob2fps>` to generate fingerprints::

    ob2fps --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz -o ob_chebi.fps

This takes just under 3 minutes on my ca. 2009 Mac desktop to process
all of the records.

The default uses the FP2 fingerprints, so the above is the same as::

    ob2fps --FP2 --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz -o ob_chebi.fps

ob2fps can generate several other types of fingerprints. (Use
:option:`--help` for a list.) For example, to generate the Open Babel
implementation of the MACCS definition use::

    ob2fps --MACCS --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz -o chebi_maccs.fps


Generating fingerprints with OpenEye
------------------------------------

If you have the OEChem Python library installed, with licenses for
OEChem and OEGraphSim, then you can use :ref:`oe2fps <oe2fps>` to
generate fingerprints::

    oe2fps --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz -o oe_chebi.fps

This takes about 40 seconds on my desktop and generates a number of
warnings like "Stereochemistry corrected on atom number 17 of",
"Unsupported Sgroup information ignored", and "Invalid stereochemistry
specified for atom number 9 of". Normally the record title comes after
the "... of", but the title is blank for most of the records.

OEChem could not parse 7 of the 95,955 records. I looked at the
failing records and noticed that all of them had 0 atoms and 0 bonds.

The default settings produce OEGraphSim path fingerprint with the
values::

    numbits=4096 minbonds=0 maxbonds=5
       atype=Arom|AtmNum|Chiral|EqHalo|FCharge|HvyDeg|Hyb btype=Order|Chiral 

Each of these can be changed through command-line options.

oe2fps can generate several other types of fingerprints. For example,
to generate the OpenEye implementation of the MACCS definition specify::

   oe2fps --maccs166 --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz -o chebi_maccs.fps

Use :option:`--help` for a list of available oe2fps fingerprints or to
see more configuration details.

Generating fingerprints with RDKit
----------------------------------

If you have the RDKit Python library installed then you can use
:ref:`rdkit2fps <rdkit2fps>` to generate fingerprints. Based on the
previous examples you probably guessed that the command-line is::

    rdkit2fps --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz -o rdkit_chebi.fps

This takes just under 6 minutes on my desktop, and RDKit did not
generate fingerprints for 1,101 of the 95,955 records.
    
You can see some of the RDKit error messages in the output, like::

    [00:47:02] Explicit valence for atom # 12 N, 4, is greater than permitted
    [00:47:02]  S group DAT ignored on line 102

These come from RDKit's error log. RDKit is careful to check that
structures make chemical sense, and in this case it didn't like the
4-valent nitrogen. It refuses to process this molecule.


The default generates RDKit's path fingerprints with parameters::

    minPath=1 maxPath=7 fpSize=2048 nBitsPerHash=2 useHs=1  

(NOTE! In chemfp 1.1 the default nBitsPerHash was 4. The RDKit default
nBitsPerHash is 2.)

Each of those can be changed through command-line options. See rdkit2fps
:option:`--help` for details, where you'll also see a list of the
other available fingerprint types.

For example, to generate the RDKit implementation of the MACCS
definition use::

  rdkit2fps --maccs166 --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz -o chebi_maccs.fps

while the following generates the Morgan/circular fingerprint with
radius 3::

  rdkit2fps --morgan --radius 3 --id-tag "ChEBI ID" ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz

Alternate error handlers
========================

In this section you'll learn how to change the error handler for
rdkit2fps using the :option:`--errors` option.

By default the "<toolkit>2fps" programs "ignore" structures which
could not be parsed into a molecule option. There are two other
options. They can "report" more information about the failure case and
keep on processing, or they can be "strict" and exit after reporting
the error.

This is configured with the :option:`--errors` option.

Here's the rdkit2fps output using :option:`--errors report`::

    [00:52:39]  S group MUL ignored on line 103
    [00:52:39]  Unhandled CTAB feature: S group SRU on line: 36. Molecule skipped.
    ERROR: Could not parse molecule block, file 'ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz', line 12036, record #179. Skipping.
    [00:52:39] Explicit valence for atom # 12 N, 4, is greater than permitted
    ERROR: Could not parse molecule block, file 'ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz', line 16213, record #265. Skipping.

The first two lines come from RDKit. The third line is from chemfp,
reporting which record could not be parsed. (The record starts at line
12036 of the file and the SRU is on line 36 of the record, so the SRU
is at line 12072.) The fourth line is another RDKit error message, and
the last line is another chemfp error message.

Here's the rdkit2fps output using :option:`--errors strict`::

    [00:54:30]  S group MUL ignored on line 103
    [00:54:30]  Unhandled CTAB feature: S group SRU on line: 36. Molecule skipped.
    ERROR: Could not parse molecule block, file 'ChEBI_lite.sdf.gz', line 12036, record #179. Exiting.

Because this is strict mode, processing exits at the first failure.

The ob2fps and oe2fps tools implement the :option:`--errors` option,
but they aren't as useful as rdkit2fps because the underlying APIs
don't give useful feedback to chemfp about which records failed. For
example, the standard OEChem file reader automatically skips records
that it cannot parse. Chemfp can't report anything when it doesn't
know there was a failure.

The default error handler in chemfp 1.1 was "strict". In practice this
proved more annoying than useful because most people want to skip the
records which could not be processed. They would then contact me
asking what was wrong, or doing some pre-processing to remove the
failure cases.

One of the few times when it is useful is for records which contain no
identifier. When I changed the default from "strict" to "ignore" and
tried to process ChEBI, I was confused at first about why the output
file was so small. Then I realized that it's because the many records
without a title were skipped, and there was no feedback about skipping
those records.

I changed the code so missing identifiers are always reported, even if
the error setting is "ignore". Missing identifiers will still stop
processing if the error setting is "strict".


Alternate fingerprint file formats
==================================

In this section you'll learn about chemfp's support for other
fingerprint file formats.

Chemfp started as a way to promote the FPS file format for fingerprint
exchange. Chemfp 2.0 added the FPB format, which is a binary format
designed around chemfp's internal search data structure so it can be
loaded quickly. (For FPB support you will need to get a copy of the
commercial version of chemfp.)

There are many other fingerprint formats. Perhaps the best
known is the Open Babel `FastSearch
<http://openbabel.org/wiki/FastSearch>`_ format. Two others are Dave
Cosgrove's `flush <https://github.com/OpenEye-Contrib/Flush>`_ format,
and OpenEye's "fpbin" format.

The `chemfp_converters package
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chemfp-converters/>`_ contains utilities
to convert between the chemfp formats and these other formats.::

  # Convert from/to Dave Cosgrove's Flush format
  flush2fps drugs.flush
  fps2flush drugs.fps -o drugs.flush

  # Convert from/to OpenEye's fpbin format
  fpbin2fps drugs.fpbin --moldb drugs.sdf 
  fps2fpbin drugs_openeye_path.fps --moldb drugs.sdf -o drugs.fpbin

  # Convert from/to Open Babel's FastSearch format
  fs2fps drugs.fs --datafile drugs.sdf 
  fps2fs drugs_openbabel_FP2.fps  --datafile drugs.sdf  -o drugs.fs

Of the three formats, the flush format is closest to the FPS data
model. That is, it stores fingerprint records as an identifier and the
fingerprint bytes. By comparison, the FastSearch and fpbin formats
store the fingerprint bytes and an index into another file containing
the structure and identifier. It's impossible for chemfp to get the
data it needs without reading both files.

Chemfp has special support for the flush format. If chemfp_converters
is installed, chemfp will use it to read and write flush files nearly
everywhere that it accepts FPS files. You can use it at the output to
oe2fps, rdkit2fps, and ob2fps, and as the input queries to
simsearch. (You cannot use it as the simsearch targets because that
code has been optimized for FPS and FPB search, and I haven't spent
the time to optimize flush file support.)

This means that if chemfp_converters is installed then you can use
:ref:`fpcat <fpcat>` (see also the next section) to convert between FPS
and flush file formats.

In addition, you can use it at the API level in :func:`chemfp.open`,
:func:`chemfp.load_fingerprints`,
:func:`chemfp.open_fingerprint_writer`, and
:meth:`.FingerprintArena.save`.

Note that the flush format does not support the FPS metadata fields,
like the fingerprint type, and it only support fingerprints which are
a multiple of 32 bits long.


Convert formats with fpcat
==========================

In this section you'll learn how to use the command-line tool
:ref:`fpcat <fpcat>` to convert between fingerprint file formats.

Chemfp 1.4 included a backport of fpcat from the commercial version of
chemfp. In the commerical version, the fpcat program is often used to
convert from the text-based FPS files into the binary FPB format, and
vice versa.

The no-cost version of chemfp does not include the FPB format, but it
does include support for Dave Cosgrove's flush file format (see also
the previous section). The fpcat program can be used to convert flush
files to FPS format and vice-versa::
  
  fpcat drugs.flush -o drugs.fps
  fpcat drugs.fps -o drugs.flush

For more control over the conversion, use flush2fps and fps2flush
respectively, from the `chemfp_converters package
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chemfp-converters/>`_.


Merge multiple fingerprint files with fpcat
===========================================

In this section you'll learn how to merge multiple fingerprint files
into one using the command-line tool :ref:`fpcat <fpcat>`, and how to
get slightly faster FPS arena load times by reordering the fingerprints.

The previous section showed how use fpcat to convert from one
fingerprint format to another.

You can also use the fpcat program to merge multiple fingerprint
files. It's based on the general idea of the Unix 'cat' program. In
the following example, I'll give it three filenames, and have it save
the concatenated fingerprints to an fps.gz file::

  fpcat filename1.fps filename2.fps filename3.fps -o output.fps.gz

Note: fpcat uses the metadata from the first file to generate the
metadata for the output. The output metadata does not currently
include the 'sources' metadata lines because that would require
opening all of the files first to get that information, then closing
the files, and reopening them to get the fingerprint data. A future
version of chemfp may support this option, and/or some way to specify
the source line(s) directly.

For example, if you generate fingerprints for a lot of
structures, you might split them up into multiple files, process them
in parallel, and use fpcat to merge the results into a single file.

More concretely, I used RDKit to convert the ChEMBL 23 SD file into a
SMILES file, which I want to process to get the MACCS
fingerprints. I'll break it up into three parts, so lines 1, 4, 7,
etc. go into one file, lines 2, 5, 8, etc. go into another, and lines
3, 6, 9, etc. go into a third::
  
  % awk 'NR % 3 == 0' chembl_23.rdkit.smi > subset0.smi
  % awk 'NR % 3 == 1' chembl_23.rdkit.smi > subset1.smi
  % awk 'NR % 3 == 2' chembl_23.rdkit.smi > subset2.smi

I'll have rdkit2fps process each subset independently in the
background (my laptop has more than 3 cores, so each job will get its
own core)::
  
  % rdkit2fps --maccs166 subset0.smi -o subset0.fps &
  [1] 13935
  % rdkit2fps --maccs166 subset1.smi -o subset1.fps &
  [2] 13943
  % rdkit2fps --maccs166 subset2.smi -o subset2.fps &
  [3] 13952

You may want to use something like GNU parallel for a more automated
solution.

Once those are done, I'll merge them using fpcat::

  % fpcat subset0.fps subset1.fps subset2.fps -o chembl_23.maccs.fps

By default the output fingerprints contain the fingerprints from the
first file, in the order they appear in the file, followed by the
fingerprints from the second file, and so on.

Chemfp goes through several steps to load an FPS file into an
arena. It loads the fingerprints into memory, it sorts them by
population count, so that fingerprints with 0 bits set come first,
then those with 1 bit set, etc., and finally it creates an index
describing the offset to each of those popcount boundaries.

As an optimization, if the fingerprints are already ordered, then
there's no need to sort them, so it skips that step. Here's an example
of the time needed to load the 1.7M ChEMBL 23 MACCS fingerprints::

  % time python -c 'import chemfp; chemfp.load_fingerprints("chembl_23.maccs.fps")'
  7.762u 0.251s 0:08.01 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w

(This was the best of 3 times.)

I can ask fpcat to reorder the fingerprints by population count. This
loads all of the fingerprints into memory, sorts them, and then saves
the fingerprints in sorted order.::

  % fpcat subset0.fps subset1.fps subset2.fps -o chembl_23.maccs.fps --reorder

As a result, the load time decreases by about 10-15%::

  % time python -c 'import chemfp; chemfp.load_fingerprints("chembl_23.maccs.fps")'
  6.681u 0.246s 0:06.94 99.7%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w

Of course, if you really want fast load performance, you should use
the FPB format in the commercial version::

  % time python -c 'import chemfp; print(len(chemfp.load_fingerprints("chembl_23.maccs.fpb")))'
  1727081
  0.078u 0.013s 0:00.09 88.8%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w

About half of the 0.09 seconds is the startup overhead for Python
itself.


chemfp's two cross-toolkit substructure fingerprints
====================================================

In this section you'll learn how to generate the two
substructure-based fingerprints which come as part of chemfp. These
are based on cross-toolkit SMARTS pattern definitions and can be used
with Open Babel, OpenEye, and RDKit. (For OpenEye users, these
fingerprints use the base OEChem library and not the separately licensed
OEGraphSim add-on.)

NOTE: All of these toolkit vendors dropped support for Python 2.7  
by 2019, so this is mostly of historical note.  I have not updated the
examples to use chemfp 1.6 as I no longer have versions of those
toolkits to test against.
 
Chemfp implements two platform-independent fingerprints where were
originally designed for substructure filters but which are also used
for similarity searches. One is based on the 166-bit MACCS
implementation in RDKit and the other is derived from the 881-bit
PubChem/CACTVS substructure fingerprints.

The chemfp MACCS definition is called "rdmaccs" because it closely
derives from the MACCS SMARTS patterns used in RDKit. (These pattern
definitions are also used in Open Babel and the CDK, but are
completely independent from the OpenEye implementation.)

Here are example of the respective rdmaccs fingerprint for phenol
using each of the toolkits.

Open Babel::

    % echo "c1ccccc1O phenol" | ob2fps --in smi --rdmaccs 
    #FPS1
    #num_bits=166
    #type=RDMACCS-OpenBabel/2
    #software=OpenBabel/2.4.1 chemfp/1.4
    #date=2018-03-16T21:47:36
    00000000000000000000000000000140004480101e	phenol

OpenEye::

    % echo "c1ccccc1O phenol" | oe2fps --in smi --rdmaccs
    #FPS1
    #num_bits=166
    #type=RDMACCS-OpenEye/2
    #software=OEChem/2.1.3.b.1_debug (20170816) chemfp/1.4
    #date=2018-03-16T21:47:54
    00000000000000000000000000000140004480101e	phenol

RDKit::

    % echo "c1ccccc1O phenol" | rdkit2fps --in smi --rdmaccs
    #FPS1
    #num_bits=166
    #type=RDMACCS-RDKit/2
    #software=RDKit/2018.03.1.dev1 chemfp/1.4
    #date=2018-03-16T21:48:12
    00000000000000000000000000000140004480101e	phenol


For more complex molecules it's possible that different toolkits
produce different fingerprint rdmaccs, even though the toolkits use
the same SMARTS definitions. Each toolkit has a different
understanding of chemistry. The most notable is the different
definition of aromaticity, so the bit for "two or more aromatic rings"
will be toolkit dependent.


substruct fingerprints
----------------------

chemp also includes a "substruct" substructure fingerprint. This is an
881 bit fingerprint derived from the PubChem/CACTVS substructure
keys. They do not match the CACTVS fingerprints exactly, in part due
to differences in ring perception. Some of the substruct bits will
always be 0. With that caution in mind, if you want to try them out,
use the :option:`--substruct` option.

The term "substruct" is a horribly generic name, but I couldn't think
of a better one. Until chemfp 3.0 I said these fingerprints were
"experimental", in that I hadn't fully validated them against
PubChem/CACTVS and could not tell you the error rate. I still haven't
done that.

What's changed is that I've found out over the years that people are
using the substruct fingerprints, even without full validatation. That
surprised me, but use is its own form of validation. I still would
like to validate the fingerprints, but it's slow, tedious work which I
am not really interested in doing. Nor does it earn me any
money. Plus, if the validation does lead to any changes, it's easy to
simply change the version number.
