        ### Description ###
        
        Python has so many packages to offer, but perhaps a bit too many. Are your imports looking messy? Well PyLol is the solution for all of that. Simply put a couple of imports rather than 100 and still get the same results!
        
        #### Usage ####
        
        Use PyLol for many things like Async Development and Opening Files, manipulate JSON Files, Do Maths and many more

        All new functions in define state:
        # ALL THE FUNCTIONS WILL HAVE THE SAME NAMES AS THEIR PROPER MODULES SO WHEN USING THEM, YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN ANY NEW SYNTAX #
