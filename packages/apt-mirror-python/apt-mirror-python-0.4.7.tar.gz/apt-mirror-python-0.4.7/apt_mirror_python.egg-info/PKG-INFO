Description: # apt-mirror rewritten by Python
        
        
        This project is started as a line by line translate from apt-mirror 0.5.4, so it is 100% compatible with apt-mirror config file.
        
        In v0.2 it becomes an object-oriented program.
        
        ## Usage:
        Get help from http://apt-mirror.github.com/
        
        ## Todo:
        
        * Automatically check the checksum of index files before download archive files.
        * If check failed, retry several times.
        * threading.Queue for download threads.
        * Accept command line arguments to override variables from mirror.list file.
        
        Any improvement is welcome.
