This package creates a quaternion type in python, and further enables numpy to
create and manipulate arrays of quaternions.  The usual algebraic operations
(addition and multiplication) are available, along with numerous properties
like norm and various types of distance measures between two quaternions.
There are also additional functions like "squad" and "slerp" interpolation, and
conversions to and from axis-angle, matrix, and Euler-angle representations of
rotations.  The core of the code is written in C for speed.
