Hello Wai,
The switch has been replaced successfully under OA# UKIM20010718399.
AP's and camera are shifted back to original ports. All the services are up and confirmed fine. Hence we will be proceeding with the closure
of the RTPA and subjected case i.e. UKIM20010718399.
As it was mentioned by you that the old switch is still in rack and cannot be removed due to one out of four screw stuck in. Also this cannot be
done next week as you are unavailable and will be back on March 02, 2020.
Once this this switch gets removed from the rack on or after March 02, 2020 we will help you with the scheduling and pick up on return RMA.
To follow up ahead on this case I have raised a new case at my end i.e. 2002N62950.

As per discussion, there is no more impact and users who were using the wired LAN connections will be moving on wireless network until the switch
gets replaced. Moreover the RTPA can be downgraded to Yellow.
RMA status 
Faulty device is holding the 8X5XNBD contract. RMA ETA is still awaited from Cisco.

Hello Wai,
As discussed, since the member is showing removed in stack and therefore we are not able to check further.
No User impact as they will be using the nearby APs for connectivity however we are raising an Orange RTPA since 3 AP's and LAN connection are
still down.
We are raising RMA now and will share ETA soon.
Hello GCC IR,
Please this is for your information.

Hi Himanshu,
The whole logical switch is NOT down and it is just one of the switch members had a power supply and switch issue. The three connected APs and LAN connections are
disrupted in that part of the building while users will be using the nearby APs for connectivity.
From the switch configuration, did you see any other critical types of connection base on the interface description on this particular stack?
Regards,
Wai
