# freqit
Better frequency and crosstab tables.

This is a work in progress meant to provide better functionality and more options in constructing frequency tables for data analysis. Currently one-way tables are supported, crosstabulation tables to come in the future.

The package takes a pandas series and outputs a frequency table for the values within the column. 

Freqit requires that pandas and numpy are installed in the operating environment.
