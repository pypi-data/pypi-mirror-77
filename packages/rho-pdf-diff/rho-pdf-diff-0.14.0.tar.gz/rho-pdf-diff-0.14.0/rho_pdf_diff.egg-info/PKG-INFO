Description: # rho-pdf-diff
        
        Package forked from https://github.com/JoshData/pdf-diff
        
        ## Installation
        This package relies on the system dependency `pdftotext`.  After that is 
        installed, simply install using `setup.py` with `pip install -e .[dev,test].
        
        ## Usage
        ### Script
        There is an included script for generating a text diff between two PDF 
        documents, `rho-pdf-diff`.  The simplest usage is:
        
        `rho-pdf-diff <old-pdf-path> <new-pdf-path> <output-path>`
        
        To see additional options run `rho-pdf-diff --help`.  There are a number of 
        flags for disabling some filters which attempt to remove unimportant diffs.
        
        ### Library
        The main workflow for creating diff images from raw documents can be found in 
        the source of the `rho-pdf-diff` script.  This essentially involves creating a 
        `Document` object for both of the old and new PDFs, and passing these to 
        initialize a `DiffResult`.  `DiffResult` also can take a sequence of 
        `DiffFilter` objects, which are essentially rules for using information 
        available at the `Document` level for removing unwanted diffs from being 
        included in the final result.
        
        After the text diff is created by the logic in `DiffResult`, a searchable PDF
        containing the side-by-side documents with diffs marked is generated using the 
        `DiffImageWriter` class.  Note: the page alignment step is currently *very* slow
        for long documents with many diffs.
