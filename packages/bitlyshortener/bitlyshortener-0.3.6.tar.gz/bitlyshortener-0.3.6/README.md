# bitlyshortener
**bitlyshortener** is a Python 3.7 based high-volume Bitly V4 URL shortener with a memory-cache.
It requires and uses one or more generic access tokens provided by Bitly which it uses semi-randomly.
As a disclaimer, this is an unofficial package and it has no association with Bitly.

Other Bitly operations are outside the scope of this package.

## Requirements
### Tokens
#### Obtaining tokens
This package doesn't include any access token. To obtain one:
* Sign up for a new Bitly account at [https://bitly.com/a/sign_up](https://nullrefer.com/?https://bitly.com/a/sign_up).
An email address such as `YourGmailUsername+SomeSuffix01@gmail.com` should work.
* When asked "How will you use your links?", select "For personal use".
* If presented the "Your Links Are Everything" page, click "Skip this step".
* Verify the email address by clicking the link in the confirmation email.
It can on rare occasions be necessary to have the confirmation email resent.
* Under "Profile Settings", select "Generic Access Token".
* Enter password and click Generate Token.

#### Rate limits
The following are the known rate limits per token:
* Per minute: 100 (presumably for status 200 or 201) [[ref]](https://dev.bitly.com/v4/#section/Rate-Limiting)
* Per hour: 1000 (presumably for status 200 or 201) [[ref]](https://dev.bitly.com/v4/#section/Rate-Limiting) 
* Per month: 1000 (presumably for status 201 only) [[ref] (requires login)](https://nullrefer.com/?https://app.bitly.com/organization/1/detail)

Bitly sends a monthly email if if 50% of the account's usage limit for new short links is exceeded for the calendar month.
If this email is received, it is suggested to immediately obtain and add additional tokens to the pool used by this package.
As follows, it is preferable to stay under 50% of the usage limit by having a sufficiently big pool of tokens.

It is unknown what the per-IP rate limit is, if any.

### Python
Python 3.7+ is required.
Any older version of Python will not work due to the use of 
[`ThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor)
with an *initializer*.

## Usage
To install the package, run:

    pip install bitlyshortener

Usage examples:
```python
from bitlyshortener import Shortener

tokens_pool = ['9fbe2864bb8872f5027c103321ff91be90aea687', '0cbe3864bc8872f5027c103321ff91be30aea787']  # Use your own.
shortener = Shortener(tokens=tokens_pool, max_cache_size=8192)

# Shorten to list
urls = ['https://paperswithcode.com/sota', 'https://arxiv.org/', 'https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent']
shortener.shorten_urls(urls)
['https://j.mp/2TuIwfz', 'https://j.mp/2t8R7cu', 'https://j.mp/2GohbIt']

# Shorten to dict
urls = ['https://news.google.com', 'https://yahoo.com/']
shortener.shorten_urls_to_dict(urls)
{'https://news.google.com': 'https://j.mp/2TzvYnq', 'https://yahoo.com/': 'https://j.mp/2TCihE4'}

# Normalize diverse preexisting Bitly links
urls = ['http://j.mp/2Bo2LVf', 'http://bit.ly/2BombJQ', 'https://cnn.it/2Ggb2ih', 'https://j.mp/websniffer']
shortener.shorten_urls(urls)
['https://j.mp/2BtckCt', 'https://j.mp/2BlS1qw', 'https://j.mp/2TEVtUt', 'https://j.mp/2BmjqbZ']

# Show cache info
shortener.cache_info
{'Shortener._long_url_to_int_id': CacheInfo(hits=0, misses=9, maxsize=2048, currsize=9)}
```

To obtain the fastest response, URLs must be shortened together in a batch as in the examples above.
A thread pool of up to 32 concurrent requesters can be used, but no more than up to five per randomized token.
For example, if two tokens are supplied, up to 2 * 5 = 10 concurrent workers are used.
If eight tokens are supplied, then not 8 * 5 = 40, but a max of 32 concurrent workers are used.
The max limit can, if really necessary, be increased by setting `config.MAX_WORKERS` before initializing the shortener.

Returned short links use the `j.mp` domain with HTTPS.
Any preexisting Bitly short links are also normalized to use this domain.
