Soccer API (Application Programming Interface) is a simple wrapper build on top
of some bookmakers (888sport, bet365 and Unibet) in order to get data about
soccer (aka football) odds using python commands.

## ‚öΩÔ∏è The goal

The goal of the project is provided a enjoyable way to get odds data for
different soccer leagues. Usually, if someone want to get these types of data,
have to build by him self (and from scratch) a program able to scrape the
betting site or use some kind paid API. Soccer API try to address this problem.

## üí° The philosophy

Keep it simple. Simple API, simple http requests, few dependencies. In the past
I have try to build some heavy framework able to scraping site (using selenium
able to handle complex JavaScript): was a unmaintainable nightmare.

## üìò The documentation

The following section contain all the useful information to use this API at
its best. Read it carefully.

### Installation

Use your favorite python package manager (like *pip*, *pipenv*, *poetry*). For
example if you use *pip* type in your terminal:

```bash
pip install soccerapi
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, if you want a kind of testing/developing setup, you can install
Soccer API directly from source code by first cloning the repository from github
and then install dev dependencies ([pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
is required)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S1M0N38/soccerapi.git
cd soccerapi
pip install -e .
pipenv install --dev
```

and then activate the enviroment

```bash
pipenv shell
```

### Usage

Import the *soccerapi* bookmaker, define the *api* varibale, reuquest the *odds*.

```python
from soccerapi.api import Api888Sport
# from soccerapi.api import ApiUnibet
# from soccerapi.api import ApiBet365

api = Api888Sport()
odds = api.odds('italy', 'serie_a')

print(odds)
```

```python
[
  {
    'time': '2020-01-12T19:45:00Z'
    'home_team': 'Roma',
    'away_team': 'Juventus',
    'both_teams_to_score': {'no': 2380, 'yes': 1560},
    'double_chance': {'12': 1320, '1X': 1710, '2X': 1360},
    'full_time_resut': {'1': 3200, '2': 2160, 'X': 3450},
  },

  ...

  {
    'time': '2020-01-13T19:45:00Z'
    'home_team': 'Parma',
    'away_team': 'Lecce',
    'both_teams_to_score': {'no': 2280, 'yes': 1600},
    'double_chance': {'12': 1270, '1X': 1270, '2X': 1960},
    'full_time_resut': {'1': 1850, '2': 3850, 'X': 3800},
  }
]
```

the _odds_ method return a list of next events of the request competition
(in the example: country='italy' and league='serie_a'). For a complete list
of supported bookmakers and releated competitonstake a look at the
[competitons table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTTAsRWCJxQrrrbxpC4s12QwfDRKcmstbc5A1f6VnDSHN1TcTjjRgMMJfhc0dqbfqCw3dTtsCFBg7G_/pubhtml?gid=187969326&single=true).

### Country restriction

The regulation of online gambling varies from country to country. There are
differnt versions of the betting site depending of the provenince of your
http request. Moreover most of bookmakers implement some kind of VPN detection
that block VPN-http requests. Due to these constrains it's diffcult to test
soccerapi for worldwide usability. Here is reported some resum of bookmaker
accecibilty from various country.
