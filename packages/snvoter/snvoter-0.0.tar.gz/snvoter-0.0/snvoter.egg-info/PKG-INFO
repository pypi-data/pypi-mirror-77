        ## Creation of a dedicated conda environment
        
        SNVoter uses several fixed versions of its dependencies. Users are encouraged
        to use a conda or similar environment to isolate the packages from their
        default python instance. An environment file is available in the GitHub
        repository.
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/vahidAK/SNVoter.git
        conda env create -f SNVoter/env/environment.yaml
        conda activate snvoter
        ```
