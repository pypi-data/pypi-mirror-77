Changelog MySimpleGUI
=====================
vs 1.1.1  2020-08-20
--------------------
All warnings.warn messages are now either suppressed (if followed by a PopupError) or 
will raise a RuntimeError Exception with the original message.

vs 1.1.0  2020-08-13
--------------------
Complete change of code. Instead of importing PySimpleGUI, the complete source code is now read from
PySimpleGUI and patched where required. This is a much more flexible approach that also allows for
future patches to be applied relatively easy.

SUPPRESS_ERROR_POPUPS is now always False, even if you try and set it.

Exception and PopupError handling included.

The generated code can be run as a separate (forked) package, if required.

vs 1.0.0  2020-07-28
