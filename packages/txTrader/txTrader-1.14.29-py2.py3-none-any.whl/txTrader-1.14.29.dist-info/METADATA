txTrader - Twisted Trading API Controller 
=========================================

txTrader aims to eliminate the complexity of managing and interacting with multiple trading system APIs, presenting a native python interface.


Features
--------
- Cross-Platform securities trading API management engine   
- Provides a trader's eye view of the interaction with the trading system API.    
- Decouples business logic from low-level implementation details of interaction with the broker's API 
- Maintains internal data structures used to verify each step of the order management / trade execution transaction.   
- Supports fault-tolerance by maintaining a continuous connection with the API in the event of application failure.
- Frees trading software design from timing and architectural constraints imposed by the API implementation.
- Built on the mature and reliable [twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) python networking engine.
