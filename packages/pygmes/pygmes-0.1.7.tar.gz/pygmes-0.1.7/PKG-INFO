Description: # pygmes is a wraper for GeneMark-ES
        
        This project aims at making GeneMark-ES more usable. By default 
        GeneMark-ES has some problems with fragmented and incomplete genomes.
        
        For metagenomic analysis this is an issue, thus I developed pygmes.
        
        ## Status
        Currently this project is very much WIP, so do expect problems and
        incomplete documentation.
        
        It is just on pip already as it is a suggested package for EukCC (https://github.com/Finn-Lab/EukCC/)
