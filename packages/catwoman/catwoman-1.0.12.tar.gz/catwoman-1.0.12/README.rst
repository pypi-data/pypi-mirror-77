==========================================================================

``catwoman`` is a Python package that models asymmetric transit lightcurves where planets are modelled as two semi-circles with different radii in any orientation, for any radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law. 

``catwoman`` uses the integration algorithm developed for the ``batman`` package (Kreidberg 2015), from which ``catwoman`` builds upon.
