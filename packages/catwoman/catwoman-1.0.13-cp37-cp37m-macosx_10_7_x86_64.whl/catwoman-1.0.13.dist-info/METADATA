catwoman: A transit modelling Python package for asymmetric light curves
==========================================================================
.. image:: https://github.com/KathrynJones1/catwoman/raw/master/docs/cw.png

``catwoman`` is a Python package that models asymmetric transit lightcurves where planets are modelled as two semi-circles with different radii in any orientation, for any radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law. 

``catwoman`` uses the integration algorithm developed for the ``batman`` package (Kreidberg 2015), from which ``catwoman`` builds upon.
