        Sewer is a Let's Encrypt(ACME) client.  
        It's name is derived from Kenyan hip hop artiste, Kitu Sewer.  
        
        - The current release is [0.8.3](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/notes/0.8.3-notes).
        - More history in the [CHANGELOG](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/CHANGELOG).
        
        > Note that with 0.8.3, the promise made elsewhere about stuff changing is
        starting to come true.  `--action` is still accepted but deprecated, and
        will be dropped soon.  Likewise `--dns`, replaced by `--provider`.  Some new
        options have been added, and more of both additional features and breaking
        changes lie ahead.
        
        PYTHON compatibility: 3.5 is nominally still supported, and with assistance
        from Github's multi-version Python linting I've caught a couple things.  I
        believe that the main code is 3.5 clean, but there are a few legacy DNS
        drivers that may not run under 3.5.  For 0.8.3 I will fix any reported 3.5
        issues, but I suspect this will be the last release to promies that.

        ## Features
        - Obtain or renew SSL/TLS certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)
        - Supports acme version 2 (current RFC including post-as-get).
        - Support for SAN certificates.
        - Supports [wildcard certificates](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/wildcards).
        - Bundling certificates.
        - Supports [DNS and HTTP](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/UnifiedProvider) challenges
          - List of currently supported
            [DNS services and BYO-service notes](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/dns-01)
          - HTTP challenges are a new feature, no operational drivers in the tree
            yet.  [See usage and BYO-service notes](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/http-01)
        - sewer is both a [command-line program](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/sewer-cli)
          and a [Python library](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/sewer-as-a-library) for custom use
        - Well written(if I have to say so myself):
          - [Good test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/komuW/sewer)
          - [Passing continuous integration](https://circleci.com/gh/komuW/sewer)
          - [High grade statically analyzed code](https://www.codacy.com/app/komuW/sewer/dashboard)
          - type hinting to support mypy verification is a recently begun WIP

        sewer(since version 0.5.0) is now python3 only.  To install the (now
        unsupported) python2 version:
        
        ```shell
        pip install sewer==0.3.0
        ```
        
        Sewer is in active development and it's API will change in backward incompatible ways.

        ## FAQ
        - Why another ACME client?          
          I wanted an ACME client that I could use to programmatically(as a library) acquire/get certificates. However I could not 
          find anything satisfactory for use in Python code.
        - Why is it called Sewer?
          I really like the Kenyan hip hop artiste going by the name of Kitu Sewer.
