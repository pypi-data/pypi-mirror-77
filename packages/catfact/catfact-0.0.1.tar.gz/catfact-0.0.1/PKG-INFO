Description: forcats (in python)
        ===================
        
        This is a port of the popular R package forcats to python.
        
        **NOTE:** I am in the process of moving the forcats module from [machow/siuba](https://github.com/machow/siuba) to here.
        In the meantime, you can install and use it from there.
        
        First, install siuba:
        
        ```
        pip install siuba
        ```
        
        Then, you can import forcats using...
        
        ```
        from siuba.dply.forcats import fct_lump, fct_reorder          # etc..
        ```
