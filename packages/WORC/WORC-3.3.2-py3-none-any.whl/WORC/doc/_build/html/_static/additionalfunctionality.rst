ComBat
--------

ComBat feature harmonization is embedded in WORC. A wrapper, compatible with
the other tools provided by WORC, is included in the installation. However,
the actual code to run ComBat has to be obtained from https://github.com/Jfortin1/ComBatHarmonization,
as this repository is not installable. If you would like to use ComBat, the
following steps have to be performed:

1. Go to the folder where WORC is installed.
2. Create a folder called "ComBat" in the external folder within the WORC
  installation folder.
3. Go the the mentioned Github, clone or download the repository, and put
  the contents in the created ComBat folder.

Note: we currently use the MatLab based implementation. Make sure you have
MatLab installed on your machine.
