# Librec-auto

## Purpose

The librec-auto project aims to automate recommender system studies using Librec. 

## Workflow

The workflow of an study involves identifying appropriate data, creating 
training / test splits, implementing or choosing algorithms, running experiments
(possibly with a range of different parameters), and reporting on the results.

## Configuration

Librec-auto uses an XML-based configuration system similar to Maven or Ant. 

## Project structure

This directory contains the Python libraries for the librec_auto module. There are two other affiliated
respositories:

- librec-auto-java: Contains the java source for the wrapper between LibRec () and librec-auto, which is implemented
in the jar file: auto.jar.
- librec-auto-sample: Contains sample data and configuration files that can be used to explore the functionality
of librec-auto
