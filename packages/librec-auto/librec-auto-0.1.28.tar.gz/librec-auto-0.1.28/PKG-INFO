Description: # Librec-auto
        
        ## Purpose
        
        The librec-auto project aims to automate recommender system studies using Librec. 
        
        ## Workflow
        
        The workflow of an study involves identifying appropriate data, creating 
        training / test splits, implementing or choosing algorithms, running experiments
        (possibly with a range of different parameters), and reporting on the results.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Librec-auto uses an XML-based configuration system similar to Maven or Ant. 
        
        ## Project structure
        
        This directory contains the Python libraries for the librec_auto module. There are two other affiliated
        respositories:
        
        - librec-auto-java: Contains the java source for the wrapper between LibRec () and librec-auto, which is implemented
        in the jar file: auto.jar.
        - librec-auto-sample: Contains sample data and configuration files that can be used to explore the functionality
        of librec-auto
        
        top-level
        * /jar
            * Contains the jar files for LibRec and the wrapper. 
        * /rules
            * Contains the rules for translating configuration data to LibRec properties format.
        * /librec_auto
        	* Contains the Python code for the project.
        * /doc
        	* Contains documentation for the project
        * /test
        	* Contains the unit tests (not many right now)
