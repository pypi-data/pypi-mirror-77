        Lyncs.clime is a faithful Python interface to c-lime.
        [c-lime] is a C-API for creating, reading, writing, and manipulating LIME files
        and offers a small set of utilities for examining, packing and unpacking LIME files.
        
        LIME (which stands for Lattice QCD Interchange Message Encapsulation or more generally,
        Large Internet Message Encapsulation) is a simple packaging scheme for combining records
        containing ASCII and/or binary data. Its ancestors are the Unix cpio and tar formats and
        the Microsoft Corporation DIME (Direct Internet Message Encapsulation) format.
        
        It is simpler and allows record sizes up to $2^{63}$ bytes, making chunking unnecessary
        for the foreseeable future. Unlike tar and cpio, the records are not associated with Unix files.
        They are identified only by a record-type (LIME type) character string, analogous to the familiar
        MIME application type.

        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed via `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install [--user] lyncs_clime
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The following classes are available in lyncs_clime: Reader, ...
        
        
        ## Contributing
        
        When contributing to the package, clone the source from [github](https://github.com/Lyncs-API/lyncs.clime):
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/Lyncs-API/lyncs.clime
        cd lyncs.clime
        ```
        
        install the package in development mode:
        
        ```
        pip install -e .[all]
        ```
        
        and run the test-suite for checking the correctness of the installation:
        
        ```
        pytest -v
        ```
        
        If everything goes well, you should see all the tests passed and obtain a coverage report.
        
        A main implementation requirement is an **high code-coverage**.
        If you are going to implement something new, please, also add the respective
        test files or functions in the `test/` directory.
        
        Another implementation requirement is to **format the code** via [black](https://github.com/ambv/black)
        and to use [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) for improving the code standard.
        
        These packages can be installed via pip:
        
        ```
        pip install black pylint
        ```
        
        Before any commit, run black from the source directory:
        
        ```
        black .
        ```
        
        When you are done with the implementation, try to resolve as many comments/warnings/errors
        as possible brought up by `pylint`:
        
        ```
        pylint lyncs_clime
        ```
        
        **NOTE:** pylint and black are incompatible in few formatting assumptions. Please, ignore
        the comments C0303 and C0330 of pylint. If they show up in the files you have edited/added,
        please, add the following line after the documentation string at the beginning of the respective files:
        
        ```
        # pylint: disable=C0303,C0330
        ```
