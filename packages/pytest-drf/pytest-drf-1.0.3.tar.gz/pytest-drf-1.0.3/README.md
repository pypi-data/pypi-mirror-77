pytest-drf is a [pytest](http://pytest.org) plugin for testing your [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) APIs.

Much like Django REST Framework offers conventions and conveniences to ease the development of Django-powered APIs, pytest-drf offers conventions and conveniences to ease the development of DRF API tests.

Where DRF provides API Views, pytest-drf provides `APIViewTest`
```python
