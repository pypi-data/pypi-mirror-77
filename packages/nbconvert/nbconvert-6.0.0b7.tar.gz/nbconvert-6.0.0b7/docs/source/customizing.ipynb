    "One of the challenges of dealing with custom metadata is to handle the case where the metadata is not present on every cell.

Specifically, the following code will error:\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "{% endblock any_cell %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moderate**: If you want custom config or a composition of files, you'll want to instead make a template directory. Create the directory `mytemplate` and add the following files to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `index.html.j2` -- copy the contents of the cell we use to write `mytemplate.html.j2` to the file system.\n",
