Description: This package provides logging utilities for TensorFlow Coder's Colab notebook
        interace.
        
        **As a user of TF-Coder, you should not need to install this package yourself.**
        
        In the Colab tool, we would like to log usage data for TF-Coder, so that we can
        identify scenarios where TF-Coder can be improved. This usage data will help us
        improve TF-Coder for everyone. We also believe that the usage data can form a
        dataset that will be a valuable resource to the broader program synthesis
        research community.
        
        This data collection is completely optional.
