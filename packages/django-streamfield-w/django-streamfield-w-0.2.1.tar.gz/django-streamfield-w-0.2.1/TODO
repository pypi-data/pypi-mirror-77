Response to request with pk f3e19cd5-b19e-4a1b-a4e7-30694e30816d has content type text/javascript but was unable to parse it

## Widgets
x(but logical?) Cursor movement jumps when fly-validatitng temporal
x(not possible) Sideways expanding charfields?

## CSS

## Field
x Cant get rid of toplevel error class because written in in Admin (colours all the blocks, not the relevat ones)

## blocks
Not tried groups. This seems to be Wagtail UI affair, and can probably be deleted.
TitleBlock?
CodeBlock?
x FooterBlock?
x HeaderBlock?
'required' not getting into template
Test ModelChoices
Put 'default' someplace else? It's only used on Choosers?
'default' is the last relic of Wgatils 'pile the attributes on the Media object' approach. Without it, the code to load attributes on Media can be removed.
Can we 'init'?
'label' is unused, except for errors in StaticBlock. Can we do label mods, or does this disrupt the Javascript?

File uploader again?
List should have max/min
Collection Values are inconsistently implemented, holding bound blocks sometimes.
Collection blocks would recursively render better if Block values cartried associated fields, not just the collection block

## Fields
Needs a lot of tidying
(retain) get_searchable_content
x(no) Remove pre-save
What are dynamic templates for? If that is over-configuration, remove them


## Style

## Test
Oh dear
