Description: Steam Acolyte
        =============
        
        Lightweight user account switcher/login keeper for steam.
        
        This tool provides a simple UI to switch between different steam user accounts
        without having to reenter your password/2FA. This works by copying the
        credentials depot which contains a login token for the last active user to a
        temporary location. This config is restored to the appropriate location when
        the particular user is selected from the UI.

        There is no magic interaction with steam here, and we do not store any
        credentials independently from steam!
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the latest version from PyPI::
        
            pip install --user steam-acolyte
        
        If you want this application to live independently from other python packages,
        I recommend using pipx_ rather than *pip*.
        
        .. _pipx: https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/
        
        For windows, an all-inclusive .exe file can be created using pyinstaller from
        the development files as follows::
        
            pip install pyinstaller
            pyinstaller steam-acolyte.spec
        
        For your convenience, a prebuilt .exe can also be downloaded from the `github
        releases`_ page.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Simply launch ``steam-acolyte`` instead of ``steam``.
        
        In order to switch users, exit steam via the "Exit" option. In particular do
        **not** use the "Change Account..." option from the steam menu (this will
        invalidate the login token)!
        
        It is advisable not to mix launching steam via acolyte or regularly (this
        might result in your active logins being invalidated), and I therefore
        recommend modifying your steam launcher to execute ``steam-acolyte``.
