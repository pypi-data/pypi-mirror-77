        Rinse_ works with both Python 2 and Python 3.  Continuous integration 
        testing is performed against the latest python 2.7, python 3.3 and
        python 3.4 releases.
        
        The name "rinse" refers to its dictionary meaning, such as the act of 
        removing soap suds from something using water.
        
        The goal of rinse is to be a SOAP client that focuses on the minimum set 
        of features required to make SOAP calls to services over HTTP/HTTPS.  
        Support for common SOAP extensions including WSA (WS-Addressing) and 
        WSSE (WS-Security) is provided.  Rinse supports the WS-I Basic Profile 
        Version 2.0 specification *in principle*, but takes a pragmatic approach 
        to achieving compliance based upon further goals and constraints 
        outlined below.
        
        Using rinse as part of a SOAP service (SOAP server) is *not supported*.  
        We recommend servers should use JSON for data interchange over RESTful 
        HTTP(S) rather than providing SOAP services.  And we're not the only 
        ones - Google announced its plans to abandon SOAP way back in 2009.
        
        Security is improved by using the defusedxml_ library to parse XML data 
        thereby minimising risks associated with parsing and processing data 
        from untrusted sources.  TODO: SSL certificate pinning to ensure that 
        clients using rinse only disclose information to and parse information 
        from intended servers.
        
        Rinse has support for validating SOAP messages against the schema 
        specified in XSD (XML schema definition) format within a given WSDL 
        file, but is not capable of generating SOAP service bindings at runtime.  
        Future development may provide support for generating bindings from WSDL 
        in the form of Python source files.  Dynamic (runtime) binding is 
        unlikely to be supported.
