Description: # Control Things Serial
        
        ctserial goal is to become the security professional's Swiss army knife for interacting with raw serial devices
        
        # Installation:
        
        As long as you have git and Python 3.6 or later installed, all you should need to do is:
        
        ```
        pip3 install ctserial
        ```
        
        # Usage:
        
        First, start the tool from a terminal.  Then connect to your serial device and interact with it.  For example:
        
        ```
        ctmodbus> connect /dev/your-serial-device
        ctmodbus> sendhex deadc0de        (sends actual hex, so 4 bytes)
        ctmodbus> sendhex \xde \xad c0de  (sends same hex as before, ignoring spaces and \x)
        ctmondus> send Dead Code 国        (sends full utf-8 string without spaces)
        ctmodbus> send "Dead Code 国"      (Use quotes if you need spaces)
        ctmodbus> exit
        ```
