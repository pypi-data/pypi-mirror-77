        # What is Pints?
        
        PINTS (Probabilistic Inference on Noisy Time-Series) is a framework for optimisation and Bayesian inference on ODE models of noisy time-series, such as arise in electrochemistry and cardiac electrophysiology.
        
        PINTS is described in [this publication in JORS](http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.252), and can be cited using the information given in our [CITATION file](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/CITATION).
        More information about PINTS papers can be found in the [papers directory](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/tree/master/papers).
        
        
        ## Using PINTS
        
        PINTS can work with any model that implements the [pints.ForwardModel](http://pints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_classes_and_methods.html#forward-model) interface.
        This has just two methods:
        
        ```
        n_parameters() --> Returns the dimension of the parameter space.
        
        simulate(parameters, times) --> Returns a vector of model evaluations at
                                        the given times, using the given parameters
        ```
        
        Experimental data sets in PINTS are defined simply as lists (or arrays) of `times` and corresponding experimental `values`.
        If you have this kind of data, and if [your model (or model wrapper)](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/examples/stats/custom-model.ipynb) implements the two methods above, then you are ready to start using PINTS to infer parameter values using [optimisation](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/examples/optimisation/first-example.ipynb) or [sampling](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/examples/sampling/first-example.ipynb).
        
        A brief example is shown below:  
        ![An example of using PINTS in an optimisation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pints-team/pints/f2e28d09a2668f883a7358ae7aaad4b4572554eb/example.svg)

        The full code can be [viewed here](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/examples/sampling/readme-example.ipynb) but a friendlier, more elaborate, introduction can be found on the [examples page](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/examples/README.md).
        
        A graphical overview of the methods included in PINTS can be [viewed here](https://pints-team.github.io/pints-methods-overview/).
        
        ### Examples and documentation
        
        PINTS comes with a number of [detailed examples](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/examples/README.md), hosted here on github.
        In addition, there is a [full API documentation](http://pints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), hosted on readthedocs.io.
        
        
        ## Installing PINTS
        
        You'll need the following requirements:
        
        - Python 2.7 or Python 3.5+
        - Python libraries: `cma matplotlib numpy scipy tabulate`
        
        These can easily be installed using `pip`. To do this, first make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:
        
        ```
        $ pip install --upgrade pip
        ```
        
        Then navigate to the path where you downloaded PINTS to, and install both PINTS and its dependencies by typing:
        
        ```
        $ pip install pints
        ```
        
        To install PINTS as a [developer](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), use
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/pints-team/pints.git
        $ cd pints
        $ pip install -e .[dev,docs]
        ```
        
        To uninstall again, type
        
        ```
        $ pip uninstall pints
        ```
