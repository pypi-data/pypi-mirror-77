All changes will be documented in this file

## [2.0] - TBA (Not released yet)

### Added

- Added windows to remove and add websites
- Added splitters in each tab
- Added 'view' to view the exact  or approximate answer in a separate window
- Added CHANGELOG.md
- Added option to type in equation with equals sign in left expression
- Added option to approximate integrals. This overrides normal integration
- Added option to substitute variables in the Evaluate tab
- Added dialog to select tabs to show
- Added tests

### Changed

- Massive overhaul of structure. Each tab is defined as a separate class that loads its ui from a .ui file. This makes it much easier to add, remove or change individual tabs. The class of each tab handles everything from adding special menu bar actions to eventfilters
- Output type is now located in the menu instead of a group of radiobuttons in each tab
- CAS.py has been removed and is replaced by qt_assets/main.py
- qt_gui.py's only purpose is now to call the launch_app() function imported from qt_assets/main.py
- The textbrowser that holds the approximate answer has been enlarged vertically.
- Prime Factor tab has now two text browsers. One for displaying as a dict and for displaying as a string
- Wordwrap on the text browser that displays the exact answer has been disabled and is instead enabled on view -> view exact answer
- Settings -> Accuracy is no longer checkable and always displays accuracy
- Each tab is now split into a separate .py and .ui file. This adds around 11 ms to start but it makes it way easier to manage
- Prime Factor tab now consits of a QLineEdit with QRegExpValidator instead of QSpinBox


### Fixed

- Inconsistencies in the ui has been fixed
- Fixed a bug where shell clear wouldn't remove the list of previously executed commands
- Fixed bug where application would detect, but still crash when trying to preview or calculate even though a formulas wasn't selected
