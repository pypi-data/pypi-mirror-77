        # Setup
        The below will get you going.
        ```
        git clone git@github.com:chrishannam/jocasta.git
        cd jocasta
        [sudo] pip install virtualenv
        virtualenv .
        source bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python src/jocasta/collector.py
        ```
        
        Assuming that works you will need to configure services.
        
        # Configuring Third Party Services
        
        ```
        cp src/jocasta/settings/__init__.py.example src/jocasta/settings/__init__.py
        
        
        # populate the fields with the third party settings and uncomment the services you want
        $EDITOR src/jocasta/settings/__init__.py
        
        ```
