Description: This is a library for Flask for developers from Centre of Technology and Innovation (CTI) from Asia Pacific University
        to be able to simply implement CAS (Central Authentication Service) by annotating their view functions with the
        decorators provided in this library.
        
        ## Quickstart
        ```
        from flask import Flask
        from apu_cas import require_service_ticket 
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        @app.route('/')
        @require_service_ticket
        def hello_world():
            return 'Hello, World!'
        ```
        
        This will secure the endpoints with CAS Authentication and consumer of the secured endpoints will have to pass a valid string
        of service ticket through as query parameter, 'ticket'.
        
        For example:
        ```
        GET http://localhost:5000?ticket="ST-575303-I0RYRmVuzlRb4cCkD6jYyw3ISV8ip-172-32-13-200"
        ```
        
        The above method is related to CAS REST Protocol, for more information such as how to authenticate with CAS REST protocol,
