Description: # Torch_pdegraph
        Torch_pdegraph is a proof of concept that how one can solve PDEs (partial difference equations)  on graphs using the Message Passing class of torch_geometric and hence also befits from the hardware acceleration. See the presentation. 
        
        ## What is a PDE on a graph?
        The basic idea is that one can define the operators like, derivatives, gradients, laplacians on graphs and construct a PDE inspired from nature on graphs.
        To know more about PDEs on graph.
        - See the publications of [Elmoataz](https://elmoatazbill.users.greyc.fr/pub.html). 
        - See also their [applications on pointclouds](https://elmoatazbill.users.greyc.fr/point_cloud/index.html)
        - Classical PDEs on images by [Guillermo Sapiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAmig8cw7H8&list=PLEE9b2lRB-R0vii_n3A_3ec9F_Bp_U9Fh&index=2&t=3s)
        - Be sure to see the jupyter-notebooks in the **applications/** folder presenting few of their applications. 
        - Ref to operator_calculus.md for a brisk intro to calculus on graphs.
        
        ## Installation 
        First [install](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) the torch_geometric. Then one can clone this project and install it locally:
        
        ```shell
        pip install .
        ```
        
        Or do:
        
        ```shell
        pip install torch_pdegraph
        ```
        
        ## Running the notebooks
        In the notebooks I am demonstrating few applications of pdes on images and pcd by creating simple knn-graphs on gpu. One will need [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/master/INSTALL.md) library to create the graphs.
        
        To display the pcds inside the notebook I am using jupyter visualization feature in open3d which uses a jupyter widget, notebooks must be running to for the widget to function.
