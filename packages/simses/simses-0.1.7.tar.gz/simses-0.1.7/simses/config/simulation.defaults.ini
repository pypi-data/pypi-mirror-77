;   Strategy: desired application (Single Use or Multi Use).
;       Please make sure to use a load, generation or technical profile that matches with the application.

;       Max SOC: Upper SOC limit for the specified operation strategy in p.u ]0,1]

;       PowerFollower (standard): A specified AC power profile is attempted to be simulated with the storage
;       SocFollower: A specified State-of-Charge profile is attempted to be simulated with the storage
;       ResidentialPvGreedy: A residential storage with a PV-system is simulated (greedy strategy)

;       SimplePeakShaving: A strategy to reduce the peak load
;           Max Power: This value determines the peak-shaving limit
;       PeakShavingPerfectForesight: A strategy to reduce the peak load. Assumes perfect foresight of the load profile
;           and keeps SOC as low as possible in order to reduce calendar aging.
;           Max Power: This value determines the peak-shaving limit
;       FcrOperationStrategy: A strategy to participate in the FCR market (German regulations) without recharge
;           Power FCR: How much power should be offered to the FCR market?
;           SOC set: Target SOC for FCR simulations
;       FcrIdmOperationStrategy: A multi-use to participate in the FCR market (German regulations) with IDM recharge
;   MIN_SOC in p.u [0,1[ and MAX_SOC in p.u ]0,1]: Lower SOC limit and upper SOC limit of the storage system.
;       For IntradayRechargeOperationStrategy to determine the SOC range at which it is necessary to charge
;       or discharge the storage system. Set to different values if the SOC range of the technology differs from [0;1].
