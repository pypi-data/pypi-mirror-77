    PURPOSE:
    Generates a set of frequencies corresponding to different numbers of notes per octave.

    INPUT VALUES:
        m: The number of steps in an octave. 12 is standard.
        f0: Baseline frequency. 440 Hz is conventional starting point for A4 pitch.
        base: The base of growth for frequencies. Determines how fast the frequencies increase.
        low_thresh: The lowest frequency allowed. 20 Hz is low limit of human hearing.
        high_thresh: The highest frequency allowed. 8000 Hz traditionally the 8th octave.
    
    COMPUTED VALUES:
    n: Number of half steps away from the fixed note. Higher note = (+), lower = (-)
    fn: Trequency of the note n half steps away.
    a: (base)^(1/m) = the mth root of the base.
