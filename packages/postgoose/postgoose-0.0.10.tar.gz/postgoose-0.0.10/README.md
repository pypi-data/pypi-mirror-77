# SQL migrations for Postgres

```
PGPASSWORD=top-secret goose ./tests/master_migrations
```

(Assuming you have a Postgres server running on `localhost:5432` with a high-entropy admin password)

## Installation

```
pip install postgoose
```

## Usage

```
usage: goose [-h] [--host HOST] [-p PORT] [-U USERNAME] [-d DBNAME]
             [-s SCHEMA] [-r ROLE] [--strict_digest_check STRICT_DIGEST_CHECK]
             [-m MIGRATIONS_TABLE_NAME] [-a AUTO_APPLY_DOWN] [-V VERBOSE] [-v]
             migrations_directory

positional arguments:
  migrations_directory  Path to directory containing migrations

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST
  -p PORT, --port PORT
  -U USERNAME, --username USERNAME
  -d DBNAME, --dbname DBNAME
  -s SCHEMA, --schema SCHEMA
  -r ROLE, --role ROLE

  --strict_digest_check STRICT_DIGEST_CHECK
                        Set Flase to compare with saved digest instead of re-computing digest.
                        Default is True

  -m MIGRATIONS_TABLE_NAME, --migrations_table_name MIGRATIONS_TABLE_NAME
                        Default is goose_migrations

  -a AUTO_APPLY_DOWN, --auto_apply_down AUTO_APPLY_DOWN
                        Accepts True/False, default is True

  -V VERBOSE, --verbose VERBOSE
                        Accepts True/False, default is True

  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```

Where `migrations_directory` is some directory of form:

```
./migrations
  1_up.sql
  1_down.sql
  2_up.sql
  2_down.sql
  3_up.sql
  3_down.sql
```

Current main difference from Play Framework migrations is that a migration in Goose is all-or-nothing.

E.g. you are on master branch on revision 5 and want to switch to a feature branch whose latest revision is 4'.

```
1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5
       \
         3' <- 4'

```

Applying migrations through Goose will leave you on either revision 5 (if an error is encountered) or revision 4' (if migration is successful) but not on any of 4, 3, 2, or 3'.
