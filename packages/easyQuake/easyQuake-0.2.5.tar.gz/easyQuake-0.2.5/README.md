# easyQuake

Simplified machine-learning driven earthquake detection, location, and analysis in one easy-to-implement python package.

On most systems you should be able to simply:
```
pip install easyQuake
```
Or if you need to tweak something, like the number of GPUs in gpd_predict, you could:
```
git clone https://github.com/jakewalter/easyQuake.git
cd easyQuake
pip install .
```

## Requirements
This code leverages machine-learning for earthquake detection. You should have suitable hardware to run CUDA/Tensorflow, which usually means some sort of GPU. This has been tested on servers with nvidia compute cards and modest multi-core desktop with consumer gaming nvidia card (e.g. Geforce 1050 Ti). The event-mode can be run efficiently enough on a laptop.

* Requires nvidia-cuda-toolkit, obspy, keras==2.3.1, tensorflow-gpu==2.1 (if using multiple GPUs only tensorflow 1.15 is tested), basemap
* I've found that the the easiest way to install cuda, tensorflow, and keras is through installing Anaconda python and running ```conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.1```

## Running easyQuake
The example runs easyQuake for a recent M6.5 earthquake in Idaho
