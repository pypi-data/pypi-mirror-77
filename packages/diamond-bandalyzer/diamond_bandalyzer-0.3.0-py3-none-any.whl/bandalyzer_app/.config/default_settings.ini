; Settings for the diamond solver.  The most important settings are the solver type, the z_mesh_defintion and the
; q_external_definition.

; Z_mesh can be auto generated, or can be directly specified as a range or list of ranges.
; Auto generation relies on the specified diamond_thickness and z_mesh_maxpoints to make a controlled guess.
; This follows the typical python range, [start, stop, step], and is half open [start, stop). If you specify a list
; make sure it is in order, and avoid having overlaps, i,e, stop_range1 =< start>range2.

; Q external definition takes a line-space [start, stop, number of points], so the number of solutions you want can be easily controlled.

; defect populations can be addressed.  I.e. the amount of negativley charged defect could be added with NV-.
; the percentage ratio could be added with NV- / NV.  Spaces must be between each variable or operator.
; As many rows as required can be added.  Defect names are those specified in the defects.ini.
