        ## What is Py-AutoML?
        Py-AutoML is an open source `low-code` machine learning library in Python that aims to reduce the hypothesis to insights cycle time in a ML experiment. It mainly helps to do our pet projects quickly and efficiently. In comparison with the other open source machine learning libraries, Py-AutoML is an alternative low-code library that can be used to perform complex machine learning tasks with only few lines of code. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as `scikit-learn`, 'tensorflow','keras' and many more. 
        
        The design and simplicity of Py-AutoML is inspired by the  two principles KISS (keep it simple and sweet) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) . We as engineers have to find a way  effective way to mitigate this gap and address data related challenges in business setting. 
        r
        Py-AutoML is a minimalistic library which not  simplifies the machine learning tasks and also makes our work easier
