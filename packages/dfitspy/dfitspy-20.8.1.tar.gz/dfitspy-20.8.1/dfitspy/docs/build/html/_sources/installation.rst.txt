============

dfitspy is written in python 3.6 (and work in python 3.8.2). It needs only the following libraries:

* Numpy v1.14.3 or higher: Numerical python
* astropy v4.0.1: FITS reader library

Other libraries are used, but they are all part of the standard python library. As such no extra installations are needed.

        for Mac user you might get problem with the libmagic library.
        You might want to install py37-magic from macports.
        Thanks to A. Mehner for this.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last dfitspy version is v20.7.1 (1st version of July 2020) and is available in the main pypi repository. To install it::

     pip install dfitspy --user

Using this command will allow you not to have to install any other package. Pip will install what is missing for you.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The installable package can be found in the github directory under the ''dist'' directory. Take the last version and run::

	pip install dfitspy-X.Y.Z.tar.gz --user

In the version number of dfitspy, X is the year, Y is the month, and Z is the number of revisions in that month. Therefore 20.5.5 means, fifth revision of May 2020.
