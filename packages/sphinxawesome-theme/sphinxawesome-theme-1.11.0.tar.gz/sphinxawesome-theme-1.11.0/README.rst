This is an awesome theme for the `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ documentation generator. See how the theme
looks on the `demo page <https://sphinxawesome.xyz>`_.


--------
Features
--------

The theme includes several usability improvements:

.. features-start

Copy code blocks
    Code blocks have a **Copy** button, that allows you to copy code snippets to the
    clipboard.

Improved links after section titles and captions ("permalinks")
    Clicking on the ``#`` character that appears when hovering over headlines and
    captions copies that link to the clipboard. The tooltips for links after headlines
    also show the section title, instead of the generic "Permalink to this headline".
    Admonitions also include a link for easy referencing.

New directive for highlighting placeholder variables
    The theme supports a new directive ``samp``, which is the equivalent of the
    built-in ``:samp:`` interpreted text role. This allows you to highlight placeholder
    variables in code blocks.
