Description: ``collective.jsonify`` exports your Plone content to JSON_.
        
        Many packages that export data from Plone have complicated dependencies, and so
        only work with Plone 3.0 or higher (or not even with 3.0).
        ``collective.jsonify``'s only dependency is simplejson_. It can be installed in
        any Plone version as far back as:
        
        - Plone 2.1 (or probably even Plone 2.0, but not tested)
        - Zope 2.6.4 (with CMF rather than Plone)
        - Python 2.2
        
        The exported JSON_ is a collective.transmogrifier_ friendly format. Install
        ``collective.jsonify`` on a site you want to export from, and setup an import
        transmogrifier pipeline on the site you're importing to, using the blueprints in
        the collective.jsonmigrator_ package.
        
        Alternatively use the provided export script by adding it to an external method as described in `using the exporter`_.
        
        For more information see the documentation_.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.5 (2020-08-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixing Out of Memory by swapping base64 implementation.
          [gogobd]
        
        - Fix acquisition when object in folder has attribute name.
          [maartenkling]
        
        - Fallback for TypeError when _get_at_field_value is broken computedfield.
          [maartenkling]
        
        - Add runhook support.
          [gotcha]
        
        
        1.4 (2018-09-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Try Subject and Contributors when subject and contributors give nothing.
          [maurits]
        
        - Check if value exists on file like fields
          [agitator]
        
        - Export creation_date and modification_date for all objects, not only _is_cmf_only_obj.
          For dexterity these values are not present in a schemata, so they are not included as part
          of the normal schemata based dexterity export.
          [sunew]
        
        - Use self.decode method to get stringified field value when wrapping content
          for export.
          [instification]
        
        
        1.3 (2017-12-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Export plone.app.redirector redirects, if available.
          Comply with default expectations of redirector section in plone.app.transmogrifier.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Do not export FormGen and Redirection tools.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Show translations from LinguaPlone if canonical is available.
          [agitator]
        
        - Fixed value for unknown fields.  The value was never calculated
          fresh for these fields, so you got the value of the previous field.
          Or you probably got a NameError if this was the first field.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix manifest
        - Added `CHANGES.rst merge=union` to `.gitattributes`
          [ale-rt]
        
        - Added the history to JSON export.
          [rristow]
        
        
        1.2 (2016-05-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not require simplejson if we already have the native json module
          [ale-rt]
        
        - When doing an export with ``export_content`` and having constraints to skip
          items, still allow to walk into subitems of the skipped ones - except for
          skipped paths, where the whole path is skipped.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.1 (2015-10-22)
        ----------------
        
        - set json repsonse headers
          [jensens]
        
        
        1.0 (2015-05-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Let the wrapper test correctly for ``zope.interface`` and ``Interface``
          interfaces.
          [thet]
        
        - In the wrapper class, call the value in decode, if it's a callable.
          [thet]
        
        - When serializing datetime, date, time or DateTime properties, just use the
          unicode representation which can be parsed.
          [thet]
        
        - When serializing values, if there is no special handler for a field type,
          just try to unicode the value.
          [thet]
        
        - Fix export of defaultPage and layout. Before, always the defaultPage was set
          now layout is always set and defaultPage only, if there is one defined.
          [thet]
        
        - Handle plone.formwidget.geolocation Dexterity field types.
          [thet]
        
        - Check, if wrapper methods for Zope/CMF objects are Zope/CMF only objects by
          testing for Archetypes and Dexterity first.
          [thet]
        
        - Add ``BlobField`` for ``get_archetypes_fields``.
          [thet]
        
        - Don't try to convert ints to unicode in get_properties().
          [djowett]
        
        - Zope 2.6 support for collective.jsonify.
          [djowett]
        
        - Fix setup.py to work with Python 2.2.
          [djowett]
        
        - Add error type to tracebacks.
          [djowett]
        
        - Fix read of NamedBlobImage, NamedFile and NamedBlobFile in dexterity objects.
          [djowett]
        
        - Fix read of field for unicode transcoding in dexterity objects.
          [djowett]
        
        - Make ``archetypes.schemaextender`` support more generic and handle probably
          most use cases.
          [thet]
        
        - Add ``_directly_provided`` export field for the object's directly provided
          interfaces.
          [thet]
        
        - Add json_methods module to own Extension folder, which makes it automatically
          available and unnecessary to add it to the instance's Extension folder.
          [thet]
        
        - Don't skip ``ComputedField`` fields, but just export their computed value.
          Better skip them in your transmogrifier import pipeline.
          [thet]
        
        - Allow a ``skip_callback`` function to be passed to the ``export_content``
          function. It evaluates to ``True``, if the current visited item should be
          excluded from exporting.
          [thet]
        
        - Export a content's references as list of UID values.
          [thet]
        
        - Declare the ``content_type`` of a field's value only for ``TextField`` and
          ``StringField``.
          [thet]
        
        - Add example buildouts for Plone 2.1, 2.5, 3 and 4.
          [thet]
        
        - Declare ``base64`` encoding for _datafield_FIELDNAME structures. This is used
          to correctly decode in transmogrify.dexterity.
          [thet]
        
        - Add export module from ``collective.blueprint.jsonmigrator`` and modify to
          use collective.jsonify wrapper. Use it in Plone 2.1 by adding it as external
          method.
          [thet]
        
        - PEP 8.
          [thet]
        
        - Fixing local roles export.
          [realefab]
        
        - Make ATExtensionFields serializable.
          [jsbueno]
        
        - Fixes exporting of Image types that use ATBlob.
          [jsbueno]
        
        
        0.2 (2014-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Support p.a.collection QueryField.
          [jone]
        
        - Dexterity support.
          [djowett]
        
        - Add Blob fields support. Use specific methods to retrieve
          filename, content type and size.
          [gborelli]
        
        - Add _get_at_field_value to wrappe.Wrapper in order to use accessor method
          for Archetypes fields.
          [gborelli]
        
        - @@jsonify view added. See README_JSONIFY_VIEW.rst for more
          [pieretti]
        
        
        0.1 (2011-03-14)
        ----------------
        
        - documentation added
          [garbas]
