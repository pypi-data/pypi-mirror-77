# pfxposter

A PixelFed to Mastodon and Twitter crossposter that is not written as intended. Due to the unknown error on pixelfed.social instance, Atom feeds are used for checking new posts. 

In order to post PixelFed entries to Twitter, you will need a Mastodon-Twitter crossposter, you may find them on web.

## Usage

There is a configuration file located at `~/.pfxposter`. 
```toml
updated = 2020-08-21 07:56:48+00:00

[mastodon]
mastodon_url = "https://oyd.social"
access_token = "your_access_token_here"

[pixelfed]
pixelfed_url = "https://pixelfed.social"
username = "ooguz"
```

pfxposter reads the configuration file, and runs frequently.
