lsdtt_xtensor_python is a python binder for LSDTopoTools. It directly binds in-memory the c++ code in order to use it alongside with python. 
Not all the routines are binded yet as I am still working on it. See lsdviztools for a full use of all the tools with command line/driver files/indirect python bindings.
Note that this is an intermediate package: lsdtopotools is the c++ package, lsdtt_xtensor_python offers low-level bindings to lsdtopotools and finally lsdtopytools offers the automated user-friendly scripting use.
