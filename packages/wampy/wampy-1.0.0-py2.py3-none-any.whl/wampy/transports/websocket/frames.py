    """ The framing is what distinguishes the connection from a raw TCP
    one - it's part of the websocket protocol.

    Frames can have a payload length of up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
    bytes (due to the fact that the protocol allows for a 63bit length
    indicator).

    The primary purpose of fragmentation is to allow sending a message
    that is of unknown size when the message is started without having
    to buffer that message - it is *not* supported by wampy.

    This is how a websocket frame looks according to RFC 6455
