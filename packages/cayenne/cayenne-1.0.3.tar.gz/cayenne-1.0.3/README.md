## Introduction

`cayenne` is a Python package for stochastic simulations. It offers a simple API to define models, perform stochastic simulations with them and visualize the results in a convenient manner.

Currently under active development in the `develop` branch.

## Install

Install with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install cayenne
```


## Documentation

  - General: <https://cayenne.readthedocs.io>.
  - Benchmark repository, comparing `cayenne` with other stochastic simulation packages: <https://github.com/Heuro-labs/cayenne-benchmarks>

## Usage

A short summary follows, but a more detailed tutorial can be found [here](https://cayenne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html). You can define a model as a Python string (or a text file, see [docs](https://cayenne.readthedocs.io)). The format of this string is loosely based on the excellent [antimony](https://tellurium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/antimony.html#introduction-basics) library, which is used behind the scenes by `cayenne`.

```python
from cayenne.simulation import Simulation
model_str = """
        const compartment comp1;
        comp1 = 1.0; # volume of compartment

        r1: A => B; k1;
        r2: B => C; k2;

        k1 = 0.11;
        k2 = 0.1;
        chem_flag = false;

        A = 100;
        B = 0;
        C = 0;
    """
sim = Simulation.load_model(model_str, "ModelString")
# Run the simulation
sim.simulate(max_t=40, max_iter=1000, n_rep=10)
sim.plot()
```

### Change simulation algorithm

You can change the algorithm used to perform the simulation by changing the `algorithm` parameter (one of `"direct"`, `"tau_leaping"` or `"tau_adaptive"`)

```python
sim.simulate(max_t=150, max_iter=1000, n_rep=10, algorithm="tau_leaping")
```

Our [benchmarks](https://github.com/Heuro-labs/cayenne-benchmarks) are summarized [below](#benchmarks), and show `direct` to be a good starting point. `tau_leaping` offers greater speed but needs specification and tuning of the `tau` hyperparameter. The `tau_adaptive` is less accurate and a work in progress.

### Run simulations in parallel
You can run the simulations on multiple cores by specifying the `n_procs` parameter

```python
sim.simulate(max_t=150, max_iter=1000, n_rep=10, n_procs=4)
```

### Accessing simulation results

You can access all the results or the results for a specific list of species

```python
# Get all the results
results = sim.results
# Get results only for one or more species
results.get_species(["A", "C"])
```

You can also access the final states of all the simulation runs by

```python
# Get results at the simulation endpoints
final_times, final_states = results.final
```

Additionally, you can access the state a particular time point of interest $t$. `cayenne` will interpolate the value from nearby time points to give an accurate estimate.

```python
# Get results at timepoint "t"
t = 10.0
states = results.get_state(t) # returns a list of numpy arrays
```
