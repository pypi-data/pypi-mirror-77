# Python for Marketing Research and Analytics
This package contains all of the data files, notebook files, and code modules the support the book

## Getting started
We recommend using pip to install, allowing the functions from the chapters to be easily imported
```
pip3 install python_marketing_research
```

The chapter modules, which contain all the functions defined in each chapter, are under /modules.

Once installed, the function for a given chapter can be imported:

```
from python_marketing_research_functions import chapter2

adder = chapter2.Adder(3, 4)
````

The data files are under /data and Notebooks are under /notebooks. These are not included in the pip package.
