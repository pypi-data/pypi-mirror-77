        # nbclient
        
        A client library for executing notebooks. Formerly nbconvert's ExecutePreprocessor.
        
        **NBClient** is a tool for executing Jupyter Notebooks.
        
        NBClient lets you:
        
        - **execute** notebooks
        
        Similar in nature to jupyter_client, as the jupyter_client is to the jupyter
        protocol nbclient is to notebooks allowing for execution contexts to be run.
        
        ## Origins
        
        This library used to be part of [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and was extracted into its own library for easier updating and importing by downstream libraries and applications.
        
        ## Python Version Support
        
        This library currently supports python 3.6+ versions. As minor python
        versions are officially sunset by the python org nbclient will similarly
        drop support in the future.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        See [readthedocs](https://nbclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more in-depth details about the project and API capabilities.
