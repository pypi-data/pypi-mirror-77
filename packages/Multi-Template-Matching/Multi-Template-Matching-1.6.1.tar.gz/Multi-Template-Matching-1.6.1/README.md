# Multi-Template-Matching
Multi-Template-Matching is a python package to perform object-recognition in images using one or several smaller template images.  
The main function `MTM.matchTemplates` returns the best predicted locations provided either a score_threshold and/or the expected number of objects in the image.  

The branch opencl contains some test using the UMat object to run on GPU, but it is actually slow, which can be expected for small dataset as the transfer of the data between the CPU and GPU is slow.

# Installation
Using pip in a python environment, `pip install Multi-Template-Matching`  
Once installed, `import MTM`should work.  
Example jupyter notebooks can be downloaded from the tutorial folder of the github repository and executed in the newly configured python environement.  

# Documentation
The [wiki](https://github.com/multi-template-matching/MultiTemplateMatching-Python/wiki) section of the repo contains a mini API documentation with description of the key functions of the package.

# Examples
Check out the [jupyter notebook tutorial](https://github.com/multi-template-matching/MultiTemplateMatching-Python/tree/master/tutorials) for some example of how to use the package.  
You can run the tutorials online using Binder, no configuration needed ! (click the Binder banner on top of this page).  
To run the tutorials locally, install the package using pip as described above, then clone the repository and unzip it.  
Finally open a jupyter-notebook session in the unzipped folder to be able to open and execute the notebook.  
The [wiki](https://github.com/multi-template-matching/MultiTemplateMatching-Fiji/wiki) section of this related repository also provides some information about the implementation.

# Releases
Previous github releases were archived to Zenodo, but the best is to use pip to install specific versions.
