Matplotlib Backends
===================

https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend

All the functions in the library will work with any of the interactive backends. However, if you are working in a Jupyter
Notebook then you should make sure to use the ipympl backend. If you use a different backend such as ``qt5agg`` the interactions will still work,
but the interactions will be significantly laggier than with the ipympl backend. You can make sure that you use the ipympl backend
by including the Jupyter Magic:

.. code-block:: python

        %matplotlib ipympl
