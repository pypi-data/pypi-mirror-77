ðŸš¨ **This package is under heavy development and breaking changes are likely to happen.** ðŸš¨

Features
--------

PyGeoOGC is a part of Hydrodata software stack and provides interfaces to web services
that are based on
`ArcGIS RESTful <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`__,
`WMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service>`__, and
`WFS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service>`__. It is noted that although,
all these web service have limits on the number of objects (e.g., 1000 objectIDs for RESTful)
or pixels (e.g., 8 million pixels) per requests, PyGeoOGC takes care of dividing the requests
into smaller chunks under-the-hood and then merges them.

There is also an inventory of URLs for some of these web services in form of a class called
``ServiceURL``. These URLs are in three categories: ``ServiceURL().restful``,
``ServiceURL().wms``, and ``ServiceURL().wfs``.

You can try using PyGeoOGC without installing it on you system by clicking on the binder badge
below the PyGeoOGC banner. A Jupyter notebook instance with the Hydrodata software stack
pre-installed will be launched in your web browser and you can start coding!

Moreover, requests for additional functionalities can be submitted via
`issue tracker <https://github.com/cheginit/pygeoogc/issues>`__.

Installation
------------

You can install PyGeoOGC using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pygeoogc

Alternatively, PyGeoOGC can be installed from the ``conda-forge`` repository
using `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c conda-forge pygeoogc

Quick start
-----------

We can access
`Watershed Boundary Dataset <https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/wbd/MapServer>`__
via RESTful service,
`National Wetlands Inventory <https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/>`__ from WMS, and
`FEMA National Flood Hazard <https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-hazard-layer-nfhl>`__
via WFS. The output for these functions are of type ``requests.Response`` that
can be converted to ``GeoDataFrame`` or ``xarray.Dataset`` using Hydrodata.

    resp = wbd12.get_features()
    huc12 = geoutils.json2geodf(resp)

    )
    wetlands = geoutils.gtiff2xarray(r_dict, basin_geom, "epsg:4326")

    wfs = WFS(
        ServiceURL().wfs.fema,
        layer="public_NFHL:Base_Flood_Elevations",
        outformat="esrigeojson",
        crs="epsg:4269",
    )
    r = wfs.getfeature_bybox(basin_geom.bounds, box_crs="epsg:4326")
