PyMPX
======================

The PyMPX package contains the `pympx` module for manipulating Metapraxis Empower sites.

Repetitive, manual tasks can be replaced with reliable batch code to:

+ Manipulate hierarchies and create new dimension elements and structures
+ Run Empower importer and batch commands, gracefully handling any errors
+ Bulk load data in parallel into an Empower site, significantly reducing loading times

The PyMPX package also contains the smaller modules that help you write good ETL batch processes using Python and the `pympx` module.

+ Do standard logging processes
+ Parameterize and run Jupyter notebooks as part of a batch script
+ Parallelize batch processes with directory-based queues
