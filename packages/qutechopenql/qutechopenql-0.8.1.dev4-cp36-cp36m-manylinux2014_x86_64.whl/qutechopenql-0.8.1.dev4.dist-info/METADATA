        OpenQL is a framework for high-level quantum programming in C++/Python. The framework provides a compiler for compiling and optimizing quantum code. The compiler produces the intermediate quantum assembly language and the compiled micro-code for various target platforms. While the microcode is platform-specific, the quantum assembly code (qasm) is hardware-agnostic and can be simulated on the QX simulator. For detailed documentation see [here](https://openql.readthedocs.io).

        ## Usage
        
        Example python tests and programs can be found in the 'tests' and 'examples' directories. These can be executed as 'python tests/simplePyTest.py'.
        
        Example C++ tests and programs can be found in 'tests' and 'examples'
        directories. Executables for these will be generated in 'cbuild/tests' and 'cbuild/examples' directory. An executable can be executed as: './example'
