Description: # jsoncache
        Python cache control for cloud storage models
        
        
        This library exposes a multithreaded JSON object loader that support
        Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.
        
        
        ## Why do I care?
        
        Because loading JSON files from the cloud is more annoying than you
        realize.
        
        * Sometimes you're gonna get errors - log those errors.
        * Sometimes you're going to have compressed JSON blobs because Google
          Cloud Storage has unmanageable timeouts for uploads
          (https://github.com/googleapis/python-storage/issues/74)
        * You want your application to behave as if read errors from the cloud
          weren't a problem, but you want those errors to show up in logging.
        
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        
        1. Import the ThreadedObjectCache class.
        2. Instantiate it passing in the cloud type, bucket, path and time to
           live in seconds.
        3. Call `.get()` on the ThreadedObjectCache instace.
        
        
        You can optionally pass in a custom implementation of the `time`
        module to override how `time.time()` works.
        
        You can optionally pass in a custom callable `transformer` that will
        apply the `transformer` function to the data before it's returned.
        Typical use cases might involve initializing a sklearn model.
        
        You can optionally pass in `block_until_cached`=True so that the
        constructor will block until a model is loaded successfully from the
        network.
        
        All background threads are marked as daemon threads so using this code
        won't cause your application to wait for thread death.
