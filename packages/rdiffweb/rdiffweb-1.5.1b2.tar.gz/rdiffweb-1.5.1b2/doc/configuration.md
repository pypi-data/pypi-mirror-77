# Rdiffweb configuration

## LDAP Authentication

Rdiffweb integrates with LDAP to support user authentication. 

This integration works with most LDAP-compliant directory servers, including:

* Microsoft Active Directory
* Apple Open Directory
* Open LDAP
* 389 Server.

**Requirements**

Make sure you have `python-ldap` installed either from your Linux distribution repository or from pypi using `pip`.

    sudo apt-get install python-ldap
    OR
    sudo pip install python-ldap

Plugin parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Required | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LdapUri | URIs containing only the schema, the host, and the port. | Yes | ldap://localhost:389 | 
| LdapTls | `true` to enable TLS. Default to `false` | No | false |
| LdapProtocolVersion | Version of LDAP in use either 2 or 3. Default to 3. | No | 3 |
| LdapBaseDn | The DN of the branch of the directory where all searches should start from. | Yes | dc=my,dc=domain | 
| LdapBindDn | An optional DN used to bind to the server when searching for entries. If not provided, will use an anonymous bind. | No | cn=manager,dc=my,dc=domain |
| LdapBindPassword |  A bind password to use in conjunction with `LdapBindDn`. Note that the bind password is probably sensitive data, and should be properly protected. You should only use the LdapBindDn and LdapBindPassword if you absolutely need them to search the directory. | No | mypassword |
| LdapAttribute | The attribute to search username. If no attributes are provided, the default is to use `uid`. It's a good idea to choose an attribute that will be unique across all entries in the subtree you will be using. | No | cn | 
| LdapScope | The scope of the search. Can be either `base`, `onelevel` or `subtree`. Default to `subtree`. | No | onelevel |
| LdapFilter | A valid LDAP search filter. If not provided, defaults to `(objectClass=*)`, which will search for all objects in the tree. | No | (objectClass=*) | 
| LdapNetworkTimeout | Optional timeout value. Default to 10 sec. | No | 10 |
| LdapTimeout | Optional timeout value. Default to 300 sec. | No | 300 |
| LdapAllowPasswordChange | `true` to allow LDAP users to  update their password using rdiffweb. This option should only be enabled if the LDAP if confiugred to allow the user to change their own password. Default to  `false`. | No | true |

## Email notifications

Since Rdiffweb v0.9, you may setup notification when your backup did not
run for a given period of time. This is useful to know when your backup
setup is not working. This section describes how to configure rdiffweb to notify you.

**Edit config file**

Edit rdiffweb config file `/etc/rdiffweb/rdw.conf` and edit the `Email*`
configuration parameters to suit your environment. The following is an example
using a gmail account to sent notification.

    #----- Enable Email Notification
    # The server can be configured to email user when their repositories have not
    # been backed up for a user-specified period of time. To enable this feature,
    # set below settings to correct values.
    EmailNotificationTime=6:30
    EmailHost=smtp.gmail.com:587
    EmailEncryption=starttls
    EmailSender=example@gmail.com
    EmailUsername=example@gmail.com
    EmailPassword=CHANGEME

**Restart rdiffweb**

To apply the modification, restart rdiffweb as follow:

    sudo service rdiffweb restart

**Edit your preferences**

Login to rdiffweb using your username & password. Browse to your user settings.
A new tab named "Notification" you be displayed. Click on it to change the
notification settings for each repository.

## Configure Apache - Reverse Proxy (optional)

You may need an Apache server in case:

 * you need to serve multiple web services from the same IP;
 * you need more security (like HTTP + SSL).

This section doesn't explain how to install and configure your Apache server.
This is out-of-scope. The following is only provided as a suggestion and is in
no way a complete reference.

**Install Apache and required modules**

    sudo apt-get install apache2
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    sudo a2enmod proxy
    sudo a2enmod ssl
    sudo a2enmod proxy_http

**Basic configuration**

Add the following to your Apache configuration. It's recommended to create a 
file in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/rdiffweb`.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName rdiffweb.mydomain.com
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/ retry=5
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
    </VirtualHost>

**SSL configuration**
Here an example with SSL configuration.

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName rdiffweb.mydomain.com
        ServerAdmin me@mydomain.com
        # TODO Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://rdiffweb.mydomain.com$1 [L,R=301]
        <Location />
            Order Allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *:443>
        ServerName rdiffweb.mydomain.com
        ServerAdmin me@mydomain.com

        # Hostaname resolution in /etc/hosts
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/ retry=5
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

        # SSL Configuration
        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile    /etc/apache2/ssl/my_certificate.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/my_certificate.key
        <Location />
            Order Allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

## Configure nginx (optional)

You may need an nginx server in case:

 * you need to serve multiple web services from the same IP;
 * you need more security (like HTTP + SSL).

This section doesn't explain how to install and configure your nginx server.
This is out-of-scope. The following is only provided as a suggestion and is in
no way a complete reference.

See [/extras/nginx](../extras/nginx) folder for example of nginx configuration
to be used with rdiffweb.
