        ## Introduction
        
        T.B.C.
        
        ## Installation & usage
        
        Install via **pip** or **pip3**, as in:
        
        ```
        	pip3 install diagnosticism
        ```
        
        Use via **import**:
        
        ```Python
        
        import diagnosticism
        ```
        
        ## Components
        
        **Diagnosticism.Python** provides components in the following categories:
        
        * Contingent Reporting
        * Diagnostic Logging
        * Tracing
        
        **NOTE**: for the moment, the Diagnostic Logging facilities emit to the standard error stream, via the Contingent Reporting API. In the near future this will be changed to work     with more sophisticated logging libraries, including the standard logging facilities and the (as yet to be release) **Pantheios.Python**.
        
        ## Examples
        
        Examples are provided in the ```examples``` directory, along with a markdown description for each. A detailed list TOC of them is provided in [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md).
