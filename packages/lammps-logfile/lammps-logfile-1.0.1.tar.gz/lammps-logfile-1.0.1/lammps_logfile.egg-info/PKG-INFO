        # LAMMPS logfile reader
        Tool to read a logfile produced by [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov) into a simple python data structure with a `get()`-function providing the log data. 
        
        ## Installation
        From pypi (preferred/stable)
        ```
        pip install lammps-logfile
        ```
        
        Install using pip directly from github to get the latest (possibly unstable) version:
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/henriasv/lammps-logfile.git
        ```
        Or by cloning the repository:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/henriasv/lammps-logfile.git
        cd lammps-logfile
        pip3 install .
        ```
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        ```
        import lammps_logfile
        
        log = lammps_logfile.File("path/to/logfile")
        
        x = log.get("Time")
        y = log.get("Temp")
        
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.plot(x, y)
        plt.show()
        ```
        This will give the concatenated log entries of all the runs where the style of the thermo output didn't change with respect to the last run. I.e. if the entries in the `thermo_style` was not changed between runs it will contain the log data for all the timesteps. If the `thermo_style` *was* changed, `x` and `y` will contain the data from all the timesteps after the `thermo_style` was changed for the last time. 
         
        ## Multiple runs in the same log file
        If multiple run statements have been made in a simulation, these can be retrieved bu supplying the `run_num` keyword to the `get()`-function
        
        ```
        import lammps_logfile
        
        log = lammps_logfile.File("path/to/logfile")
        
        x = log.get("Time", run_num=N)
        y = log.get("Temp", run_num=N)
        
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.plot(x, y)
        plt.show()
        ```
        In this case, `x` and `y` will contain the log data from the `N`'th `run` command in LAMMPS, counting from 0.
        
        Any invalid call to the `get()`-function will result in the function returning `None`. This happes if the user asks for a thermo propery that does not exist in the log file, or if the user asks for a `run_num` larger than the number of runs in the logfile.
