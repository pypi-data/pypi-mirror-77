CpG_distrb_region.py
=====================

Description
------------

This program calculates the distribution of CpG over user-specified genomic regions. 

**Notes**

- A maximum of ten BED files (define ten different genomic regions) can be analyzed together. 
- The *order* of BED files is important (i.e., considered as "priority order"). Overlapped
  genomic regions will be kept in the BED file with the highest priority and removed
  from BED files of lower priorities.  For example, users provided 3 BED files via  "-i
  promoters.bed,enhancers.bed,intergenic.bed", then if an enhancer region is overlapped
  with promoters, *the overlapped part* will be removed from "enhancers.bed".
- BED files can be regular or compressed by 'gzip' or 'bz'.

Options
--------

  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i CPG_FILE, --cpg=CPG_FILE
                        BED file specifying the C position. This BED file
                        should have at least three columns (Chrom, ChromStart,
                        ChromeEnd).  Note: the first base in a chromosome is
                        numbered 0. This file can be a regular text file or
                        compressed file (.gz, .bz2).
  -b BED_FILES, --bed=BED_FILES
                        List of BED files specifying the genomic regions.
  -o OUT_FILE, --output=OUT_FILE
                        The prefix of the output file.
