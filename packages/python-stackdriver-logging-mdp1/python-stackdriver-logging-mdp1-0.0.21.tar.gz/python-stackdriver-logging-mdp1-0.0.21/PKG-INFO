Description: 
        # Logging library for Python using Stackdriver
        
        ## Reference for good logging
        [here](https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python/)
        Check out 'Write logging records everywhere with a proper level' section 
        
        
        ## To use logging:
        1. Copy logging.yaml and stackdriver.py into the project you want to use
        2. In order to import the logger, 'from stackdriver import stackdriver_logger' 
        3. In order to initialize the logger, 'mdp_logger = stackdriver_logger()'
        4. In order to use the logger, 'mdp_logger.info('shows up on stackdriver and console')'
        
        ## Logging Levels in current configuration (set in logging.yaml)
         - debug: lowest level and logs of these kinds don't show up as of current configuration
         - info: info logs will show up on stdout and in stackdriver
         - warning: warn logs will show up on stdout and in stackdriver
         - error: error logs will show up on stdout and in stackdrtiver
         - critical: critical logs will show up on stdout and in stackdriver
        
        ## Change log level that shows up in Stackdriver
        In logging.yaml, under handlers:stackdriver, change the level field to the lowest level you want to see in stackdriver.
        Anything that level and higher will now show up.
        
        ## Change log level that shows up on console
        In logging.yaml, under handlers:console, change the level field to the lowest level you want to see show up in console.
        Anything that level and higher will now show up.
