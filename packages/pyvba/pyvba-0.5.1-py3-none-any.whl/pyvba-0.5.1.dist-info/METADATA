The pyvba package was designed to gather data from VBA-based applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, CATIA, etc.). It
may also be used to assist programming VBA macro scripts in a more sensical language. 

## Getting Started
Install the Python Package:
```cmd
pip install pyvba
```

To export data from a VBA program:
```python
import pyvba

catia = pyvba.Browser("CATIA.Application")
active_document = catia.ActiveDocument

exporter = pyvba.XMLExport(active_document)
exporter.save("output", r"C:\Documents")
```

The current supported output types are XML and JSON formats.

## Developer Notes

applications. Contributors are welcome! The project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/TheEric960/pyvba). Report
