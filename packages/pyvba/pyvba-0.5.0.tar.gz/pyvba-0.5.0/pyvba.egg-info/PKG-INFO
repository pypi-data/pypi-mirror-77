        The pyvba package was designed to gather data from VBA-based applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, CATIA, etc.). It
        may also be used to assist programming VBA macro scripts in a more sensical language. 
        
        ## Getting Started
        Install the Python Package:
        ```cmd
        pip install pyvba
        ```
        
        To export data from a VBA program:
        ```python
        import pyvba
        
        catia = pyvba.Browser("CATIA.Application")
        active_document = catia.ActiveDocument
        
        exporter = pyvba.XMLExport(active_document)
        exporter.save("output", r"C:\Documents")
        ```
        
        The current supported output types are XML and JSON formats.
