"""
PyPika is divided into a couple of modules, primarily the ``queries`` and ``terms`` modules.

pypika.queries
--------------

This is where the ``Query`` class can be found which is the core class in PyPika.  Also, other top level classes such
as ``Table`` can be found here.  ``Query`` is a container that holds all of the ``Term`` types together and also
serializes the builder to a string.

pypika.terms
------------

This module contains the classes which represent individual parts of queries that extend the ``Term`` base class.

pypika.functions
----------------

Wrappers for common SQL functions are stored in this package.

pypika.enums
------------

Enumerated values are kept in this package which are used as options for Queries and Terms.


pypika.utils
------------

This contains all of the utility classes such as exceptions and decorators.
