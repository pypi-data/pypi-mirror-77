        ## What is Luminaire
        
        [Luminaire](https://zillow.github.io/luminaire/luminaire/docs_source/_build/html/Introduction.html) is a python package 
        that provides ML-driven solutions for monitoring time series data. Luminaire provides several anomaly detection and 
        forecasting capabilities that incorporate correlational and seasonal patterns as well as uncontrollable variations in 
        the data over time.
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        Install Luminaire from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/luminaire/) using ``pip``
        
        ```bash
        pip install luminaire
        ```
        
        Import ``luminaire`` module in python 
        ```python
        import luminaire
        ```
        
        Check out [Luminaire documentation](https://zillow.github.io/luminaire/luminaire/docs_source/_build/html/Introduction.html) 
        for detailed description of methods and usage.
        
        
        ## Time Series Outlier Detection Workflow
        ![Luminaire Flow](luminaire/docs_source/assets/luminaire_flow.gif)
        
        Luminaire outlier detection workflow can be divided into 3 major components:
        
        ### Data Preprocessing and Profiling Component
        
        This component can be called to prepare a time series prior to training an anomaly detection model on it. This step applies
        a number of methods that make anomaly detection more accurate and reliable, including missing data imputation, identifying and removing recent outliers from training data, necessary mathematical transformations, and data truncation based on recent change points. It also generates profiling 
        information (historical change points, trend changes, etc.) that are considered in the training process. 
        
        Profiling information for time series data can be used to monitor data drift and irregular long-term swings.
        
        ### Modeling Component
        
        This component performs time series model training based on the user-specified configuration OR optimized configuration 
        (see Luminaire hyperparameter optimization). Luminaire model training is integrated with different structural time series
        models as well as filtering based models. See [Luminaire outlier detection](https://zillow.github.io/luminaire/luminaire/docs_source/_build/html/basic_usage_tutorial/outlier_batch.html)
        for more information.
         
        The Luminaire modeling step can be called after the data preprocessing and profiling step to perform necessary data preparation before training.
         
        ### Configuration Optimization Component
         
        Luminaire's integration with configuration optimization enables a hands-off anomaly detection process where
        the user needs to provide very minimal configuration for monitoring any type of time series data. This step can be combined with
        the preprocessing and modeling for any auto-configured anomaly detection use case. See [fully automatic outlier detection](https://zillow.github.io/luminaire/luminaire/docs_source/_build/html/basic_usage_tutorial/optimization.html#fully-automatic-outlier-detection)
        for a detailed walkthrough. 
        
        
        ## Anomaly Detection for High Frequency Time Series
        
        Luminaire can also monitor a set of data points over windows of time instead of tracking individual data points. This approach is well-suited
        for streaming use cases where sustained fluctuations are of greater concern than individual fluctuations. See [anomaly detection for streaming data](https://zillow.github.io/luminaire/luminaire/docs_source/_build/html/basic_usage_tutorial/streaming.html) for detailed information.
