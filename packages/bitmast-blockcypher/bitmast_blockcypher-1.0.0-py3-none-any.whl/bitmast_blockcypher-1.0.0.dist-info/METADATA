# Bitmast BlockCypher wrapper
**A python wrapper for accessing Blockcypher API and selected bitcoin features**

The Bitmast BlockCypher tool is a python implementation of the BlockCypher, [https://www.blockcypher.com/quickstart/](https://www.blockcypher.com/quickstart/).

## Motivation
The BlockCypher API while a very rich collection of blockchain tools and services does not readily fit the design model
needed by Bitmast in deploying custom blockchain payment and other exchange services. To augment the work done by
BlockCypher, Bitmast Digital Services designed and developed this wrapper which can be integrated to other python based
frameworks or tools for developing applications for niche markets.

## Dependencies
The wrapper requires `blockcyher` and `bitcoinlib`.
The target Python language for current implmentation is Python 3.6.8

## Build Status
**Version: 0.1.0**

Current development is version 0.1.0. This is considered the Alpha Edition.

## Features
Support PayStack features includes:
+ Generate bitcoin or registered blockchain wallet and addresses
+ Generate HD wallet
+ Sign blockchain transactions locally
+ Generate private and public keys
+ Verify addresses for given network
+ Create datastructures that can be used to parse blockchain API responses into native Python classes

## Contributing
Please visit application repo for further information on extending project. Ideas and comments will be reasonably
 appreciated.
