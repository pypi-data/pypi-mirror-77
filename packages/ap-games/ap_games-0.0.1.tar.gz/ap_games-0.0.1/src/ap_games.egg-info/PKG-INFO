        The AP Games is the result of the completion of the project
        [Tic-Tac-Toe with AI][] at [JetBrains Academy][]. This project
        was developed just for fun and to learn Python and some
        concepts of a decision-making algorithm.
        
        ## Tic-Tac-Toe with AI + bonus **Reversi** game
        
        Tic-tac-toe, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,
        X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
        The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in
        a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
        
        ### Reversi
        
        Reversi is a strategy board game for two players who take
        turns marking the spaces in an 8x8 board.
        
        Each player must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a
        row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of
        the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned
        over to become your color. The object of the game is to own
        more pieces than your opponent when the game is over.
        See [source][reversi rules source].
        
        The example below shows the game interface:
        ```txt
        Please choose the game:
        	0 - Tic-Tac-Toe;
        	1 - Reversi.
        Print 'exit' to exit the program.
        
        Input command: 1
        Type 'start user1_type user2_type' to run the selected game,
        where user_X_type is one of the supported values:
        user, easy, hard and nightmare;
        Type 'rules' to get game rules or type 'exit' to return
        to the main menu.
        
        Input command: rules
        You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row
        of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces.
        All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then
        turned over to become your color. The object of the game is
        to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over.
        
        Input command: start user hard

        ## Installation
        
        The project has been tested only with [python 3.8][python] on
        Ubuntu Linux and Windows 10. If you have python 3.8 and above
        installed in your machine, just install the AP Games from [PyPI]:
        
        ```shell script
        python --version
        pip install ap-games
        ```
        
        You can find source code of this package on [github][].
        See [aplatkouski/ap-games][] repository.
        
        ## How to use
        
        Run module:
        ```shell script
        python -m ap_games [game] [user-1 user-2]
        ```
        Where:
        - ``game`` is a value from the following set:
            - ``0`` or ``tic-tac-toe`` for Tic-Tac-Toe game;
            - ``1`` or ``reversi`` for Reversi game.
        - ``user-1`` and ``user-2`` are values from the following
          set:
            - ``user`` for human player;
            - ``easy``, ``medium``, ``hard`` and ``nightmare`` for AI
              player.
        
        **Note**: Parameters in brackets are optional.
        
        Or open the python console and type:
        ```python
        # Python version 3.8+
        from ap_games import cli
        cli.main()
        ```
        
        ## Notes
        
        This package can be run as a console game or integrated into
        another application. This project provides the following basic
        structures:
        - ``SquareGameboard``
        - ``GameBase``
            - ``TicTacToe``
            - ``Reversi``
        - ``Player``
            - ``HumanPlayer``
            - ``AIPlayer`` - uses mini-max as decision-making algorithm.
