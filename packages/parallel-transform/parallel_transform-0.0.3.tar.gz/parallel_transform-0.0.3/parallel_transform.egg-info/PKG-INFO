Description: # parallel-transform
        A implementation of asynchronous multiprocessing with progress logging.
        
        # Installation
        ```bash
        pip install parallel-transform
        ```
        
        # Functions:
        transform_list_parallel(
                list_to_transform,
                transform_func,
                *transform_args,
                verbose=True,
                processes=-1,
                min_log_frequency=1000,
                logger=None,
                log_func='info')
        
        The elements in `list_to_transform` will be transformed based on the `transform_func` function, with the list element as the first arg, and `*transform_args` as the remaining args. If verbose is set to true, the progress every 5% or `min_log_frequency` processes will be logged, whichever is less. An optional logger can be passed; if no logger is passed, the logs will go to std out.
        
        The order of the list_to_transform is maintained.
