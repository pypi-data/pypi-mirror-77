===========

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Coiled's documentation! This guide covers the core concepts and functionality of Coiled.

Coiled helps scale Python by managing three things:

1) **Software environments**: Build, manage, and share conda, pip, and Docker environments.
   Use them locally or in the cloud.
2) **Hosted Dask clusters**: Securely deploy Dask clusters from anywhere you run Python.
3) **Users and costs**: Manage teams, collaborate, set resource limits, and track costs.
